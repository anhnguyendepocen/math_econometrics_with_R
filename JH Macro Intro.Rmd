Introduction
============

The basic precondition and starting point of any social science, including economics, is the *material* or physical existence of humans.

This chapter examines the general conditions for the ongoing existence of people in society: the conditions indispensable for the *production* of the physical lives of humans in a particular social context.[^1]

[^1]: [@Marx:2010Grundrisse1], p. 17: "To begin with, the subject to be discussed is *material production*. Individuals producing in a society---hence the socially determined production by individuals is of course the point of departure."

Due to its high level of generality and abstraction, this will probably be the most challenging chapter in the textbook. The fluidity of the terms, definitions, and concepts in this chapter may tax the readers' patience. Often, the discussion will seem to run in circles.  But, think of it as applying several layers of paint on a wall.  That is what it takes to cover it uniformly with a smooth color.

The chief goals of this chapter are to

1.  expose in general the fundamental content of all social life, which in modern societies appears in various seemingly disjoint spheres (economic, legal, political, ethical, etc.), and

2.  highlight the distinction between---on the one hand---these physical or *material* conditions, which are of a general character, and--on the other hand--the specific *social* context in which such material conditions are embedded.

Human individuals reproduce ourselves in and through our association or cooperation with other human individuals, i.e. through *society*. However, the focus of this chapter is not on this association, which configures the *internal* structure of society.[^2] Instead, the focus is on the general, necessary, and ongoing relation between humans, on the one hand, and the rest of nature, on the other hand.

[^2]: Chapter [\[c:soc\]] focuses on the general formation of *social structure* proper and chapter [\[c:ppf\_coop\]] introduces a simple formal model to study it.

To center the discussion on this humanity-nature ongoing relationship, it is helpful to imagine all individuals as forming a single social unit facing the rest of nature, a harmonious family or communist society, th

To center the discussion on this humanity-nature ongoing relationship, it is helpful to imagine all individuals as forming a single social unit facing the rest of nature, a harmonious family or communist society, thus ruling out any conflict of interest among its individual members.

Frequently, and not always in a fully conscious manner, theoretical economists use a communist society as the "natural" benchmark against which to contrast the efficiency and overall rationality of other, historically evolved social structures. The notions of the *benevolent planner* and the *social planner* in growth theory or the figure of the *auctioneer* postulated in general-equilibrium theory testify to this. In particular, the canonical proof of the *fundamental theorems of welfare economics* presuppose, without naming it, a perfect communist society as its optimal benchmark, and then invokes separation theorems to show that, under highly idealized conditions (perfect knowledge and convexity of preferences and technology), private self-regarding individuals oblivious of the constraints facing society as a whole can choose their (production, consumption, and exchange) actions and generate the communist allocation by each one choosing her actions on the sole basis of their (collectively self-consistent) market prices.

This is the proper starting point, because even though we humans are obviously a part of nature, we have a sharp sense of our uniqueness as a species and, thus, we set ourselves apart from the rest of the physical world.

The first section offers a general discussion of the process and the main activities that constitute it. The second section uses a diagram to visualize the inflows and outflows in each activity of the reproductive cycle. The third section deepens our understanding of the ultimate product of the cycle. The fourth section focuses on some important physical implications of the reproductive process.

Consumption and production ==========================

For individuals to exist and form a modern society, we must breathe air, drink water, eat food, wear clothes, shelter ourselves, transport ourselves on vehicles, read books, use electronic devices, etc.--and, therefore, we must extract, make, or build these items in the first place! In other words, individuals must conduct a host of activities that, taken collectively, *produce* us as concrete humans in our particular historical setting. These activities must recur. Thus, the material production of ourselves in society is a cyclical *reproduction*.

In the most immediate sense, the activity that reproduces people is that in which we personally appropriate, use, or *consume* a host of physical objects such as air, water, food, clothes, buildings, vehicles, roads, books, electronic devices, etc. We may call them consumable objects or just *consumables*. Additional examples of consumables follow: 

In the most immediate sense, the activity that reproduces people is that in which we personally appropriate, use, or *consume* a host of physical objects such as air, water, food, clothes, buildings, vehicles, roads, books, electronic devices, etc. We may call them consumable objects or just *consumables*. Additional examples of consumables follow:

For example: An apple on a kitchen table, ready to be eaten. Also, a car in a garage, which its owner is to use to transport herself to her workplace. Another example: a pristine beach in a Pacific island, ready for vacationers to enjoy.

Consumption or, more specifically, *personal consumption* is the activity in which individual humans use up or take in objects that directly meet our most immediate needs. Consumption is the activity by which we materially or physically produce ourselves as persons. In other words, consumption is the process by which objects are directly used by individuals in the personal production of ourselves.

These are some concrete examples that illustrate the general concept. In reading these examples, keep in mind that, in general, when consuming, the person is producing herself as a person in the world, and pinpoint

- the particular activity of consumption,

- the consumable object involved, and

- the specific result or outcome of this activity.

Several examples follow:

- A baby boy drinking milk off her mother breasts or off a bottle.

- A person using up a housing unit to shelter herself.

- A traveler using her car to transport herself from her home to a vacation resort.

- A man eating a cheeseburger and drinking a milkshake at a fast-food joint.

- A chef learning how to make a dish by reading a recipe from a cookbook.

- A pedestrian walking on a street. A teenager sleeping in a comfortable bed.

Very few, if any, of the objects a person consumes today can be grabbed directly from the natural environment. In modern societies, most consumables are not ready made by nature, simply to be seized and consumed. Before they become consumables, most raw objects drawn from nature have to be prepared or transformed. In other words, most consumables are *products*, i.e. the results of previous processes of *production*.

In turn, the production of consumables requires the use of other objects as inputs. Classical economists called objects that served as productive inputs *means of production*. A few of them can be directly extracted from nature. Most of them also require prior transformation, as do the inputs required to produce these inputs, and so on. The more a society develops, the longer the series of transformations or chain of production activities that objects must undergo before they are ready as adequate productive inputs or, at last, at the very end of the chain, as consumable objects. These are a few examples of means of production:

For example:

- Wheat is a means to producing flour, which is a means to producing pizzas. Iron ore, a mineral, is a means to producing steel, which is a means to producing machines, which in turn are means to producing cars.

- A motorized chipper in a sawmill is a means to producing wood fiber, which is a means to producing paper, which is a means to producing books.

In macroeconomics, one encounters the distinction between

1. means of production or productive inputs consumed within a given year, called *intermediate goods* (e.g. the flour used to make bread), and

2. means of production used for longer than a year, called *investment goods* or *capital goods* (e.g. the oven utilized to make bread over a decade).

This distinction is based on the convention adopted in ancient agricultural societies of the *annual* cycle as the standard period of accounting.

The chain of production processes that precede consumption has grown historically to the point of becoming the bulk of human activity, absorbing most of the resources, effort, and attention of a modern society. As a result, the activity of personal consumption proper has been reduced to a short-lived stage, a small link in the overall chain.

We refer to the entire chain of productive activities, including in it the activity of personal consumption, as the process of material *production* in general. And, again, since it is a repeated activity, we should conceive it as *reproduction* to grasp its comprehensive or totalizing character.

In the broader sense of the term, *production* is the array of material processes by which we humans produce

1. ourselves, [\[e:pc\]]{#e:pc label="e:pc"}

2. consumables, and [\[e:cp\]]{#e:cp label="e:cp"}

3. means of production. [\[e:mp\]]{#e:mp label="e:mp"}

Item 1, personal consumption, is therefore a form of production considered broadly. Production in the narrower sense of the term only includes items 2 and 3, i.e. the production of objective (material or physical, non-human) wealth. Production processes consist of extracting crude objects from nature and transforming them (or reshaping them) into suitable, useful products.

In plainer words, production designates the activities by which we make ourselves personally by consuming houses, cars, oranges, books, computers, etc. It also includes the activities by which those houses, cars, oranges, books, etc. are made. And, finally, it includes the activities by which the bricks to build the houses, the metal and rubber to make the cars, the seeds to plant the orange trees, the paper and ink to make the books, the plastic to encase the computers' circuitry and the machines to assemble the devices, etc., are made.

The following are specific examples of production in the narrow sense. When reading these examples, reflect on (1) the specific process or activity involved, (2) the productive inputs utilized, and (3) the output or result of the activity.

- A mother fixing a meal for her children at home.

- A New York City worker repairing the air conditioner equipment at a public school.

- A crew of workers drilling for oil in deep oceanic waters.

- Taiwanese workers assembling microprocessors for an American company.

- Members of the Park Slope Coop in Brooklyn stocking up the shelves of their cooperative supermarket.

These examples should make it clear that *production* in the narrow sense includes not only production of things for sale (and for profit), but also production for self consumption, production for members of one household, and production for others without exchange. In order to properly distinguish between production for sale in a market and other kinds of production the concept of private ownership needs to be introduced first. This is done in chapter [\[c:soc\]].

Production and consumption are processes that take place over some *period of time*. Therefore, they should be conceived as *flows*. The levels of the flows involved in these activities are represented by the inbound and outbound arrows. Chapter [\[a:stockflow\]] in the Appendix explains the distinction between *stock* and *flow* magnitudes.

An advantage of conceptualizing production in its broader and a narrower senses is that it helps to highlight consumption as an activity also guided and regulated by labor, i.e. as a form of production in which the product is the human person. Though in Figure [\[f:basic\]] below, production and consumption are represented as separate activities, this should not be viewed as implying that consumption and production necessarily take place separately in space, time, and circumstance. One could, of course, envision food preparation as a process of production taking place in a kitchen, by a cook, in a period of time prior to its consumption in a dining room by a person other than the cook herself. In this framing, the product, prepared food, would preexist its consumption, and it would result from an activity spatially and temporally different from the activity of consumption. However, in the case of a man shaving his own beard, production and consumption would coincide in space and time, and both would be carried out by the same person. It is the same process viewed from two opposing viewpoints. Driving oneself to a vacation resort is another case in which personal consumption and production are carried out at once and by the same person.[^3]

[^3]: It should be clear that *transportation* is a particular process of *production*. It entails a physical or mechanical transposition of people or cargo. An apple in a farm upstate New York is not identical to the "same" apple in one's refrigerator. The world with the apple in one's fridge is a physically transformed world compared to the world with that "same" apple in the farm upstate.

In a specific sense, a *product* is an object that has been transformed by humans. A product is the result or outcome of production. Thus, the products of growing wheat by a farmer would be the wheat produced and also the farmer that emerges at the end of the process--a different farmer than the one who started the process. Thus, if consumption, the immediate production of ourselves, is part of production, then the product of eating a meal is the nourished person: an object, because we humans are objects, but a peculiar human object: the *human* subject herself![^4] In the most general sense, the world transformed by human activity is *the* product. A transformed world of objects and a self-transformed world of human subjects is, thus, the *total product* of human activity.

[^4]: Though we humans are also physical *objects*, we are referred here as *subjects*, and to our experience as *subjective*, in order to distinguish us from other physical objects, the items in the non-human *objective* world.

In modern economics, particular useful objects, i.e. objects suitable for either personal consumption or productive use, whether they are products or crude chunks of nature (natural resources), are called *goods*. Classical political economists called them *use values*. Thus, the outstanding totality of goods--consumables and means of production, products and natural resources--constitute society's *wealth*.[^5]

[^5]: Classical economists used the term *land* to designate natural resources in general. Thus, land is pristine nature in general, the natural environment once human society is abstracted from it.

The term *wealth* denotes the stock of goods that individuals use, either directly in personal consumption or indirectly as means for the production of other goods.

Therefore, the elementary components of wealth are goods, whether these goods are products or natural resources.

Nature is the original source of wealth. Biologically speaking, we humans are an animal species that emerged from preexisting natural conditions on earth through a spontaneous process of natural evolution. It has been well established by scientists that modern humans and modern apes (in fact, all other existing forms of life) share a common ancestry. Plants, animals, and other forms of life--we all come from some primitive one-cell organism! Our own physical bodies are part nature and part products of our own making, results of our own history.

Every artifice, every human product is, ultimately, made up of the elements of nature transformed in accordance to some human design. If one were to take each human-made product apart, removing all the layers of human activity performed on them, one would reduce it to elements of raw nature.

It seems as if an object can only be a true natural resource for an instant. Once humans are aware of its need and existence, we are already spending labor on it, thus transforming it into a product. In this light, the totality of existing wealth can be regarded as a human-made product.

Wealth, well-being, happiness, humanity
=======================================

At first sight, it may seem as if the ultimate result of the
reproductive cycle is objective wealth: consumable wealth and (chiefly)
productive wealth or means of production. However, we established that,
in fact, objective wealth (consumables and means of production) is
simple a means for the production of ourselves via direct personal
consumption. This section emphasizes that the real core of the
reproductive cycle is the production of subjective wealth, i.e. the
reproduction of ourselves as humans in our social context.

To jump start the discussion, consider the historical origin or
etymology of the word *wealth*. It comes from Middle English, the
language spoken in medieval England. The term evolved from the words
"welthe," "weal," and "well," which denoted the well-being of people.
This is akin to the evolution of the word *health* departing from the
old Germanic words that originated the modern English words "heal" and
"whole."

Thus, historically, material objects have been recognized as wealth only
to the extent they contributed to the well-being of people. Objects were
viewed as wealth only because they were the *means* to the *end* of
personal well-being.

The condition of objects as *goods* and, therefore, as *wealth* does not
hinge on their physical characteristics *per se*, but on their
significance, meaning, or importance for us, humans. The key question
is, What does this object do for us? If it meets our needs and wants,
needs and wants that evolve historically, then it is a good, a wealth
item. If the object meets our needs or wants, then it increases our
well-being, our true and ultimate wealth. However, if the object does
not meet our needs or wants, then it is useless junk.

Said differently, the "goodness" of the object---its usefulness---is not
a physical property or a set of physical properties of the object.
Instead, the usefulness of the object is a *relation* between the
physical properties of the object and the aspirations and needs of the
individual subject.[^6]

[^6]: The significance of objects to humans, their "goodness" or
    character as wealth items, is intimately related to the question of
    *value* in economics. However, the study of value requires
    understanding of the formation of social structures. This is why the
    proper discussion of value is postponed to further chapters.  

Modern economists think of consumption as a process that yields
*utility*, a positive subjective feeling, in the consumer. For society
as a whole, the sum or aggregation of individual utilities is called
social *welfare*. Thus, welfare is the technical term denoting the
well-being of an entire society. Modern economists do not consider it
necessary to specify the precise content of the term *utility*. As a
result, they are also wary of specifying the meaning of the term
welfare. From their viewpoint, *utility* is whatever the consumer seeks
to optimize when she makes choices, and welfare is just some sum of the
individual utilities. In their view, attempts to elucidate the deeper
significance of utility and welfare (wealth, in the older sense of the
term) degenerate into empty, useless philosophizing.

Indeed, philosophers have grappled with the question of human well-being
since ancient times. In a dialogue with his predecessors, Aristotle
distinguished between *arete* (virtue or excellence), *phronesis*
(ethical or practical wisdom), and *eudemonia* (prosperity or
happiness), with the former two being the vehicles for the attainment of
the latter: the highest human good or ultimate purpose of human
existence.[^7]

[^7]: [@aristotle2009], Book I, p. 3: "Now, as there are many actions,
    arts, and sciences, their ends also are many; the end of the medical
    art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy
    victory, that of economics wealth." Note that, in Aristotle's time,
    "economics" designated the proper management of a single household,
    composed of the patrician, his children, wife, servants, and slaves.

Since the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the economists'
notion of *utility*, the individual component of *welfare*, evolved from
a reference to *pleasure* (with *pain* as its negative or *disutility*)
to *satisfaction* (vs. dissatisfaction), and then *happiness* (vs.
unhappiness).[^8] In the pleasure-satisfaction-happiness scale,
*pleasure* appeared as a merely temporary and perhaps superficial mental
state.[^9] On the other hand, *satisfaction* appears as the result of
prior effort: the feeling that results from exertion of one's capacities
to a higher level, like that of an basketball player scoring a
three-pointer under defensive pressure. Finally, *happiness* designates
not necessarily a permanent sense of elation, but rather a deeper sense
of leading a consistent life, a life with a purpose beyond oneself.

[^8]: [@bentham1996collected], p. 13: "Nature has placed mankind under
    the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is
    for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to
    determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right
    and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are
    fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we
    say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our
    subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it. In words a
    man may pretend to abjure their empire: but in reality he will
    remain subject to it all the while."

[^9]: [@mill2010basic], p. 245, responded to claims that Bentham's
    utilitarian doctrine reduced human needs to base animal urges:
    "Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal
    appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard
    anything as happiness which does not include their gratification."

Modern American psychologists decompose happiness into (1) the pleasant
life, (2) "engagement," and (3) "meaning." The first component of
happiness corresponds to pleasure in the most immediate sense. The
second component, *engagement*, relates to one's fascination or
absorption in the activity at hand to the point of losing all sense of
time and oneself, the mental state of an athlete performing at her
highest level, a mental state that psychologists call *flow*. The third
and final component, *meaning*, is about leading a life that transcends
one's own self regard, a life--perhaps--willingly placed at the service
of others.[^10]

[^10]: See [@seligman2012flourish] and [@diener2011happiness].

In sum, wealth is ultimately what humans consider meaningful and
important. Yes, consumable objects and means of production are
meaningful and important. Therefore, they are our material or objective
wealth. But, being objects, they are only wealth because they are means
to our own subjective welfare. It stands to reason that what increases
our welfare, what we deem important or meaningful, is intimately linked
to our identity as humans. It seems tautological (circular reasoning) to
say that we humans regard our own *humanity* as what is truly meaningful
or important in our lives; that what is important to us is what makes us
humans; or that our material lives are simply the vehicles in and
through which we assert our humanity.

We are thus compelled to ponder the question: What is *humanity*? What
makes us, as a species, different from the rest of nature?

Ultimate wealth or labor power
==============================

If, at its core, the material reproduction of individual humans is our
self-production as humans, the production of our humanity by means of
our humanity; if humanity is our true and ultimate wealth or welfare,
the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega of our social life,
then what is specifically the trait that distinguishes us humans from
the rest of nature? That is the question we grapple with in this
section.

Philosophers and scientists have coined a number of terms to designate
the unique set of human traits, abilities, or powers that separate us
from other forms of life. Terms such as *rationality* and
*consciousness*. Unlike other forms of life, humans tend to defy nature
and our own history. We do not simply accept what nature and prior
history endowed us with. To judge by our own history, we refuse to
simply adapt to the world as it exists. The world as it exists appears
to us insufficient, lacking. Thus, we humans set out to transform it in
accordance to our will, purpose, or design.

In other words, we humans problematize the world we face. Our human
problem is that of transforming the world from *what it is* to *what it
needs to be* for us. The recurrent human attempt to solve this human
problem is precisely *production*, i.e. the transformation of the

In other words, we humans problematize the world we face. Our human
problem is that of transforming the world from *what it is* to *what it
needs to be* for us. The recurrent human attempt to solve this human
problem is precisely *production*, i.e. the transformation of the world
as it exists into the world as we need or want it to be. Since, once we
contemplate our product (our material wealth and ourselves as
self-transformed humans), we find it again insufficient and lacking, the
problem recurs as does its solution. This is why production can only be
repeated production or reproduction.

In this light, human activity, human history in general, appears as the
evolution or development of individuals capable of carrying out
conscious, willful, or purposeful activity. The general term commonly
used to designate human purposeful activity is *labor*.

In the most general sense, the term *labor* denotes the purposeful,
conscious, or goal-oriented activity of humans.

This notion that humans engage the world purposefully is essential in
economic analysis. As we will see later, many of the usual assumptions
that economists make when studying economic behavior (e.g. the
assumption of *rationality* in consumption and production) are
extensions of this notion of labor-- meaning purposeful human activity,
activity oriented towards materializing an idea, towards implementing a
purpose, goal, or design.

The concept of labor permits us to reformulate our concept of
production. Production now appears as the transformation of the world
guided and regulated by our labor or working activity. In working, in
the labor process, we express and demonstrate our specific power as
humans, i.e. our *labor power*.

In the narrower sense, *labor power* is the whole set of abilities
residing in our bodies that allow humans to conduct our purposeful
activity or labor. Labor power is, thus, the essence of our humanity. In
the broader sense, labor power it is the productive power of our labor
residing in our material wealth and in our own bodies--the total of our
material and human wealth.

When people consume, they meet their human needs, produce themselves as
humans. They thus remain humanly powerful or become more humanly
powerful. Needs are aspirational powers. The productive force of labor.
Labor power is the substance of all human powers. The powers that humans
exercise on one another in their social interactions are always and
everywhere labor power, because we can only affect others as physical
objects that interact with other physica objects--physical forces acting
on physical forces.

If the alpha and the omega of social life is the continuous or recurrent
production of humanity, then one can rephrase the sentence and say that
the alpha and the omega of social life is the production of labor power.
Thus, reproduction is the production of labor power by means of labor
power; societies are "devices" for the production of labor power by
means of labor power.

Again, what is characteristically human is not that humans consume.
Other animal species consume as well. What is characteristically human
is that we seek to produce ourselves purposefully or consciously. As
noted, historically, human personal consumption has become increasingly
complex and refined. Consumption is preceded by an ever lengthening
chain of productive activities. Without meaning to put down other animal
species or living beings, the fact is that--generally speaking--we
humans consume not to merely vegetate or lead animalistic lives. We
consume to live *humanly*.[^11] Thus, human breathing, eating, watching
movies, etc. are functions subordinated to the reproduction of our
essential human power, which is our *labor* power, the power to act in
purposeful ways, the power to shape up our lives willfully. Consumption
is an activity that involves, increasingly, deliberate action: labor.

[^11]: As a testimonial to the increasing purposefulness of modern human
    consumption, consider the proliferation of cable networks that focus
    on life style, entertainment, and food preparation.


Labor power, freedom, knowledge
===============================

Does our concept of *labor power* include all conceivable human powers,
individual and collective? Yes! All human powers are ultimately powers
to transform nature, i.e. they are ultimately forms of the productive
*force* or *power* of labor. In other words, all human powers are forms
of *labor power*. Why? Because one's ability to transform the world
purposefully, including here our self transformation (which is, again,
the ultimate goal of human activity), is at bottom our ability to
transform the objective world.

What is in the way of our designs? The obstacles, barriers, or
constraints to one person's purposeful actions are of two kinds: (1) the
actions of other individuals and (2) the forces of the physical world.
However, since the actions of other individuals are also physical
actions, they appear to us as physical forces (if they were not
physical, they would not have any effect on us, since again we are part
of the physical world), then the obstacles to her purposeful actions are
always and everywhere physical obstacles.

The ability or power to circumvent these barriers is precisely what we
denote by terms such as *liberty* or *freedom*. These terms, which one
usually encounters in political science or ethics textbooks, are in fact
other names for labor power. Following [@berlin2017two], modern
philosophers distinguish between "negative" freedom or liberty and
"positive" one

The ability or power to circumvent these barriers is precisely what we
denote by terms such as *liberty* or *freedom*. These terms, which one
usually encounters in political science or ethics textbooks, are in fact
other names for labor power. Following [@berlin2017two], modern
philosophers distinguish between "negative" freedom or liberty and
"positive" one. The former, they define as "the absence of obstacles,
barriers or constraints" to human action, while the latter as "the
possibility of acting--or the fact of acting--in such a way as to take
control of one's life and realize one's fundamental purposes."[^12]

[^12]: [@sep-liberty-positive-negative].

Taken literally, the conventional definition of negative freedom is
absurd. Human action always and everywhere faces obstacles. Again, as a
rule, nature does not grant us wealth--ultimately, labor power--freely
and spontaneously. Our relationship with nature entails both cooperation
and conflict. Humans do not have infinite productive powers or, as
economists prefer to frame it, humans always face *scarcity*.[^13] What
permits humans to overcome the obstacles the physical world presents to
us is our finite but expanding *knowledge* of the structure and
functioning of the physical world, knowledge that we can only acquire by
a mindful transformation of the world!

[^13]: Economics textbooks declare that economics as an intellectual
    discipline exists because goods, resources, labor, etc. are scarce,
    while human needs or wants are not necessarily tethered to reality.
    One can always dream. In the terms of this discussion, *scarcity* of
    goods, resources, etc. simply means that our productive power to
    reproduce them is finite, that we do not have an infinite
    productivity. And, indeed, because we do not have infinite
    productivity, we must make choices and take actions under the
    constraints imposed by such finite productivity.
    
It is no accident that the Russians use the same term, *volia*, to designate freedom, liberty, and human will.  Of course!

It is by perceiving the world as unfit to our ever more exacting needs
and wants, by taking action to transform it into a world for us, taking
it apart and then putting back together in practice, that we are
compelled to take it apart and then put it back together in our minds,
so we are able to remake it in a form that suits our shifting demands.
By constructing buildings and bridges, we are compelled to expand our
knowledge of the laws of physics, to better understand gravity,
understand that then permits us to build better bridges and buildings.
Our expanding knowledge does not remove the obstacles, it does not
eliminate the force of gravity, but it does help us circumvent it or use
it to our own advantage. Thus, *knowledge* is another word for *freedom*
and, therefore, another word for *labor power*. We can then invoke
[@hobbes2016thomas]'s phrase, which he attributed to his mentor, Francis
Bacon: *ipsa scientia potestas est* or knowledge itself is power. In our
terms, *knowledge itself is labor power*.

What about the conventional notion of positive freedom? Is there truly a
difference between *negative* freedom, entailing the "absence" of
external barriers, and *positive* freedom, entailing "control of one's
life"? As the article in [@sep-liberty-positive-negative] makes it
clear, the latter points to "internal" obstacles to purposeful action.
First off, it is also impossible for humans to exercise full control
over our lives. Second, what are the "internal" obstacles to one's
deliberate action? Forces in or tendencies in the constitution of our
own bodies that we do not yet understand. But, again, we humans are
physical objects, a part of nature. Thus, nature is not only outside of
our bodies, but also within them--and, therefore, influencing our
consciousness, which is an aspect or manifestation of our bodily
activity. In this sense, knowledge of natural laws includes self
knowledge, knowledge of the forces that shape our behavior--blind forces
against which our conscious actions press. Upon reflection, the
negative-positive freedoms dichotomy is a distinction without a
difference.

In sum, labor power is the full extent of our human powers and of our
human freedom. As Engels wrote, citing Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,
"freedom is the insight into necessity," since "necessity is blind only
in so far as it is not understood." It is by better knowing what happens
necessarily in the world, what results from the operation of the laws of
nature, that our freedom or human powers expand.[^14] Thus, we may
restate again our notion of reproduction as a process that produces
freedom by means of freedom.[^15]

[^14]: This is from Engels ([@Engels2010], pp. 105-6): "Freedom does not
    consist in any dreamt-of independence from natural laws, but in the
    knowledge of these laws, and in the possibility this gives of
    systematically making them work towards definite ends. This holds
    good in relation both to the laws of external nature and to those
    which govern the bodily and mental existence of men themselves--two
    classes of laws which we can separate from each other at most only
    in thought but not in reality. Freedom of the will therefore means
    nothing but the capacity to make decisions with knowledge of the
    subject. Therefore the freer a man's judgment is in relation to a
    definite question, the greater is the necessity with which the
    content of this judgment will be determined; while the uncertainty,
    founded on ignorance, which seems to make an arbitrary choice among
    many different and conflicting possible decisions, shows precisely
    by this that it is not free, that it is controlled by the very
    object it should itself control. Freedom therefore consists in the
    control over ourselves and over external nature, a control founded
    on knowledge of natural necessity; it is therefore necessarily a
    product of historical development."

[^15]: In political science, the emphasis of the terms liberty and
    freedom is placed on the absence of *coercion* by others or by the
    state. Again, coercion by others is a particular form in which the
    world restricts human action. This is the case in which a particular
    individual, group, or class of people appropriates the labor power
    that results from the totality of our associations and wields it
    against the rest of society. Discuss these matters more adequately
    requires study of the subsequent chapters.

An important corollary of the claim that welfare, freedom, and knowledge
are words that denote or connote one and the same human trait, i.e.
labor power, is that any concession to superstition, magical thinking,
or mysticism represents an abdication of our humanity. The weight that
modern culture and media grants to superhumans and to extra- or
supernatural forces untettered by the laws of the physical world (as if
forces *outside* of our physical world could affect it!) corresponds to
a critique of ideology. Ideology, i.e. ideas reproduced to justify and
promote the interests of particular individuals, groups, or social
classes, can only emerge when our social structures pit us against one
another.

Labor power, knowledge, technology, and information
===================================================

Knowledge as consciousness. Knowledge as an aspect of human activity:
labor. Knowledge is not simply observations (data). Knowledge is ideas
but organized, from essence to phenomenon, from general to singular,
from content to form.

Technology in the conception of the economists as an information set
that contains as elements:

1.  a description of the finished product (a consumable or a means of
    production), specified in quality and quantity, in as much detail as
    necessary to guide labor or productive practice,

2.  a detailed list of the productive inputs (means of production)
    required as elementary components of the finished product,
    specifying quality and quantity, and

3.  a proper description of the process or procedure by which the
    productive inputs are to be combined to produce the finished
    product.

What we typically view as knowledge goods are those that permit the
easiest communication or sharing of technology. However, all wealth is
knowledge embodied physically. Not only textbooks or online manuals or
how-to youtube videos.

Teaching is to show. One can show by simply exhibiting the finished
product. The human mind can try and take that product apart and copy it,
reverse engineer it. But sharing knowledge is tricky. Each individual
body/mind comes from some background, which makes it more or less apt to
get the point that another individual body/mind wants to communicate.
That's the difficulty of human learning, not from doing but from the
experience of others (culture).

Ideas are always embodied physically: in objective wealth or in
subjective wealth (labor power) residing in our bodies. It is the human
or labor or cognitive or technology or information content embodied
physically, i.e. that appears in a physical form that makes wealth
wealth rather than just raw nature.

There are no ideal products. All products are material. There is no
wealth that is not material. But its material or physical aspect is just
the form. Its specific and essential content as such wealth is labor
power. All wealth is the projection or physical representation of
humanity or labor power. Humanity is that fascinating spar

There are no ideal products. All products are material. There is no
wealth that is not material. But its material or physical aspect is just
the form. Its specific and essential content as such wealth is labor
power. All wealth is the projection or physical representation of
humanity or labor power. Humanity is that fascinating spark that only a
portion of the physical world endowed with a superb organization can
exhibit. All other forms of matter have reflection abilities, but due to
their structure, that reflection is most primitive. Human bodies, not
individually but collectively (as a society), are the thinking bodies
(Ilyenkov).

Society and nature
==================

The proper environment (clean, healthy, in a sustainable way) conceived
as a reproducible wealth.

Nature and entropy. Entropy is defined as the opposite of usefulness to
humans, i.e. as nature proper without human imprint on it.[^16]
Thermodynamics law. Life and organized human life swims in the other
direction, but that is at the expense of increasing entropy in the rest
of the universe. Garbage or entropy is sticky. The challenge is to find
a form to cooperate with nature for the longest run. The sun will die.
For all we know, we're a tiny speck in the known physical universe. How
do we transcend as a species? We need socialism.

[^16]: "The road to understanding what entropy is begins with the primary
    distinction between *available* and *unavailable* energy. This
    distinction is unmistakenly anthropomorphic (more so than any other
    concept in the natural sciences). Indeed, energy is available or
    unavailable according to whether or not we, humans, can use it for
    our own purposes." [@georgescu1986entropy], p. 3.

Is nature useful for us? Only by chance! Entropy means randomness. Only
by accident we will find that nature throws a good pitch at us that we
can bat out of the field. Mostly, nature will make it hard for us to
figure it out and manipulate it productively.

Diagram of the reproductive cycle
=================================

Figure [\[f:basic\]], showing a diagram depicting the general cycle of
material reproduction, helps to sum up the discussion.[^2] The empty
background of the diagram represents the rest of nature, the natural
environment in which human society is embedded. The two boxes show the
main processes or activities that every society must perform,
respectively the *production* and *consumption* of objective wealth. The
boxes are connected with arrows, which indicate the inputs and outputs
of each activity. The *inputs* are the arrows pointing into the activity
boxes and the *outputs* are the arrows pointing out of them.

[^17]: The diagram follows the convention among computer programmers to
    represent *activities* by rectangular boxes, *storage units* or
    stocks as cylinders, and *flows* between storage units and
    activities (and vice versa) as arrows.

![Production of humanity]

The inputs of production are

-   *labor power* (or humanity, subjetive wealth, welfare, well-being,
    freedom, knowledge, etc.),

-   *natural resources*, and

-   *produced means of production* or objective productive wealth.

The outputs of production are

-   *produced consumables*, and *produced means of production* or
    objective productive wealth--i.e. the part of the output of
    production that feeds back into the production box as an input.

In turn, the inputs of consumption are

-   *produced consumables* and

-   *natural resources*,

and consumption's output is *labor power*.

Material need and social necessity
==================================

THIS IS PREPARATION FOR THE CHAPTER ON SOCIAL FORMATION. IT GOES AT THE
END OF THIS CHAPTER.

At this point, the needs of individuals are such that society as a whole
sets out to satisfy them. This excludes needs such as the need to *win*
in a contest or be *first* at the expense of others, the need to keep
others from eating my food without my consent, etc. The former are
called *material needs* in contrast with the latter, which will be
referred instead as *social necessities*, necessities that emerge from
particular social structures. Remember that---at this point---the
internal structure of society is being deliberately ignored. As a
result, *social necessities* cannot yet arise.

To make this point clearer: Suppose that the natural, anatomic, etc.
differences between the sexes or ages of individuals lead historically
to a division of society between *dominant* young adult males and
*dominated* females, children, and elderly, where young adult males
control access to the wealth of society and force females, children, and
elderly to submission. Under these conditions, the creation of a force

To make this point clearer: Suppose that the natural, anatomic, etc.
differences between the sexes or ages of individuals lead historically
to a division of society between *dominant* young adult males and
*dominated* females, children, and elderly, where young adult males
control access to the wealth of society and force females, children, and
elderly to submission. Under these conditions, the creation of a force
devoted to the disempowerment of women, children, and seniors may become
a social necessity of the dominant group, the young adult males,
especially if the subordinated group or groups resist actively or rebel
against the supposed social arrangement. It is by no means a material
need of society for the young adult males to maintain their rule over
the rest of society. The necessity emerges only as a result of
particular social relations or interactions between these groups, it is
the necessity to maintain, reproduce, or prop up specific social
structures.

Individuals take the rest of nature and, with the help of means of
production, transform it into goods. Or, at least, that is the purpose
that guides their actions; whether (or to which extent) their purpose is
fulfilled is quite another issue.

Goodness and value
==================

THIS IS ALSO PREPARATION FOR OTHER CHAPTERS OR FOOTNOTES.

A *consumption good* is a good that is directly used or consumed by
individuals. A means of production is a good used as in input in the
production of other goods, either consumption goods or other means of
production. A glass of water for a thirsty person is an example of a
*good* and, more particularly, a *consumption good*. A steel beam for
the construction of a building is a *good* and, more particularly, a
*means of production*---that is, a means for the production of a
building, which may be directly used by people as a dwelling place or
indirectly as a means for the production of other goods (for example, to
house a restaurant or bakery).

It must also be noted here that the usefulness of objects, the quality
that turns objects into goods, is finite. It is also contextual or
relational.

The goodness of an object is a *relation* between people as producers or
consumers and the object itself. Furthermore, the goodness of an object
must be viewed as place-, time-, and context-specific. Badness is the
negative of goodness. Goodness and badness can be viewed as the opposite
*directions* in the same continuum. The quality *goodness* (or its
negative, *badness*) entails its quantification. Determining how good
objects are for society, as opposed to how good they are for
individuals, is the process we call *valuation*. Chapter x discusses the
topic of valuation in greater detail. In the supply-and-demand model of
a market in chapter x, the notions of *preferences* and *technological
requirements* refer precisely to this very relation.

We define a *bad* is an object that decreases human well-being. A glass
of water for a person who is not thirsty, does not want, or feel no need
for the water, if imposed on that person, it may become a bad (e.g.
water-boarding). A pile of non-recyclable garbage at the factory gate is
another example of a bad. In fact, the concept of bad is unnecessary.
That is just nature or entropy which is captured in thought,
conceptually as randomness or chance. Necessity is what grasp and
therefore the measure of our power or freedom. Chance or randomness is
what escapes our control, the extent of our ignorance and, therefore,
our poverty vis-a-vis nature, our lack of freedom. Entropy (rest of
nature) is the background of the diagram.

ARE WE INCLUDING ALL PRODUCTS WHEN WE CALL THEM 'MATERIAL'? YES! IS NOT
INFORMATION A PRODUCT? NO. KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION, CONSCIOUSNESS IS
EMBODIED IN MATERIAL THINGS: HUMAN BODIES AND OTHER OBJECTS (PRODUCTS OR
POTENTIAL PRODUCTS).

The service of a good is the use or consumption of the good over a
period of time.

Land or nature vs. us
=====================

The concept of bad is bad, because it places nature as our enemy. Yet,
nature is our rival. We are humans by both cooperating with nature and
fighting with it.

We need to correct our notion now: It is not just wealth (labor power)
that we produce. We also produce extra unavailable energy, entropy,
nature that appears more difficult to grasp and manipulate--which means
less labor power (the net is positive). So, we interpret labor power at
the center of the diagram as net of the degradation that we cause by
increasing entropy. Alternatively, we can interpret the "natural
resources" flows into production and consumption as a net flow. It is by
cognition (and human activity) that we turn unavailable energy into
available or usable energy. So, it can be represented on the nature side
or on the labor power side, because they are in contradiction.

The background of the diagram is a stock or container: a resorvoir of
unusable or "unavailable" matter or energy (except by chance).

The natural environment (land) is absolutely essential for our survival
as a species. We breath the oxygen in the air, drink the water
available, use to a large extent the motive force, the energy that comes
from the sun and that nature on earth has processed in many ways. We are
a part of nature, but a part of nature with awareness, with
consciousness, with the ability to self-reflect. We operate in and on
nature as a natural force. Nature is even inside of ourselves, as there
are biological processes that are essential for the physical structures
that make up our bodies to exist.

A sustainable interaction with the rest of nature is increasingly a
necessary product we need to produce. In the last few decades, it's
become increasingly clear that human activities disrupt the natural
cycles in our planet, including the climate. Our relationship with the
rest of nature is a very complex process. We cannot easily regulate or
control the overall impact of our social life in the rest of nature. So
we have to be particularly careful, because the forces that we unleash
can backfire on us. We are all familiar with the changes in the planet's
climate, with global warming, which is attributed to certain gases that
we emit into the atmosphere that creates a greenhouse effect on the
planet and trap the heat, which then disrupts our weather patterns. This
phenomenon has the potential to cause great damage to human societies,
especially those that do not have the resources and technology to face
these weather disruptions. That is why I say that, increasingly, more by
omission than by action, but we need to deliberately produce a
sustainable relationship with the rest of nature. That has to be a
purpose and we then have to produce it, just like we develop blueprints
to build houses and then we go ahead and build houses in accordance with
those blueprints.

Finally, another output of production: waste, refuse, garbage,
pollution, chemicals that we can't use any longer and dump in the
natural environment, heat from our activity that dissipates into the
atmosphere, etc.

Clearly, when we travel for pleasure, we go on a vacation, take a cruise
to the Bahamas, etc., we are consuming, replenishing our energy,
recharging our batteries, etc. But we are also polluting, generating
garbage, etc. Note also that waste bites us back. It becomes an input of
both production and consumption. That is the case when toxic substances
make it into our products, either accidentally or as a result of some
business people deliberately cutting corners at the expense of
consumers. And clearly, when we take a walk in the park, we suffer the
pollution in the air, etc. So, waste sneaks back into our basic
processes as an undesirable but present nonetheless input to production
and consumption.

Summary
=======

Production is making goods. Consuming is using those goods. What are
goods then? Well, this is a very loose definition. Goods are whatever we
humans may regard as good, whatever enhances our welfare. By producing
wealth, we also produce entropy. Paradoxically, we carve out from nature
our anthroposphere, a space in which we make the world more hospitable
to humanity, but this is only possible because we are making it less
hospitable to us in the remainder of nature.

The stock of goods that exist at a given point in time, we call wealth.
We have to distinguish between the goods that we produce over a period
of time and the wealth that exists at a point in time. For a
clarification of the distinction between stocks and flows, see the
corresponding video clip.

Finally, welfare is human well-being or productive force of labor.

The inputs of production are natural resources (T for Terrum, land in
Latin), produced means of production (K), both capital and intermediate
goods, and labor power (L). And, of course, waste.

The outputs of production are our products: consumption goods (CG),
produced means of production (K), and waste.

The inputs of consumption are consumption goods and, unfortunately,
waste.

The outputs of consumption are ourselves, individual human beings (our
labor power and, if we are to keep these things separate, our welfare).
Another output of consumption and production is a degraded nature, which
means a reduced labor power.

We should distinguish between goods and products. Products are the
outputs of production. We produce the products. We produce some goods.
Those goods that we produce are, therefore, both goods and products. A
computer that we use for work or entertainment is a good and it's a
product. Computers don't fall from the sky. But there are also some
goods that we don't produce. For example, the oxygen in the air.
Pristine water in the Alaskan wilderness, the stars in the sky, natural
resources in general. They are goods, yet they are not products. Now,
some of our products are bads. They are, for the most part, unintended
products. But they are our products. For example, we produce garbage,
which is a bad.

Welfare and labor power results from consumption -- but also from
production (or, if you prefer, only from consumption, but including the
consumption that coincides in time with production). I could add here
that there's a fourth output of production. You see, when the human
producer gets into the production box, that is a different human being
than when she emerges out of that box. Many things happen as humans
produce. we learn how to produce, for one. we also get tired, exhausted,
perhaps even psychologically depressed. It all depends on the conditions
in the workplace, etc. Maybe that is a human being who has befriended
her coworkers and emerges out of that box an enriched and empowered
human being. Or maybe it's a lousy workplace with a despotic boss and
grumpy coworkers, and she emerges out of that box depressed and with
suicidal tendencies. So, although I'm getting ahead of myself here, I'll
say that I could have added an arrow stemming from production labeled
"welfare" (which can be positive welfare or negative welfare).
Furthermore, I could have added another arrow and connected it to the
line on top -- labor power, since, again, it is entirely possible that
as we produce, we learn how to produce more and better, and so we become
better producers, our labor power is thus produced, by producing! But I
decided that I didn't want to do that, because (and this is just a
convention I'm introducing here) I decided that when people produce and
learn and get happy or grumpy, we are in fact consuming. So that should
go more into the consumption box.

At first, the cylinder at the top of the diagram appears as a unit
storing \"welfare,\" human well-being, or whatever the apparent goal of
human consumption may be. \"Welfare\" is a good starting label, since it
is a concept commonly used in conventional economics. However, students
can then be prompted to interrogate the concept in greater depth. If
properly human, consumption cannot be a merely instinctive, mindless,
and passive process by which individuals simply reproduce ourselves
biologically. The needs of humans are culturally, historically
developed. Human needs proper are envisioned powers, powers to acquire
purposefully. Thus, the production of humanity is not only attained
through immediate consumption, but mainly and increasingly by their
activity as producers. When humans produce, their output is not simply
objective products but also ourselves as more developed producers.

Thus, upon reflection, students are guided to conclude that, if labor is
defined as general purposeful or conscious human activity, that
production (the transformation of the world by humans to meet their
needs) is guided and regulated consciously, then the distinctive essence
of \"welfare\" or \"humanity\" that gets stored in this container is the
specifically human power or ability to perform labor, i.e. labor power.
Thus labor power emerges as the alpha and the omega of the entire
reproductive circuit. Th

Thus, upon reflection, students are guided to conclude that, if labor is
defined as general purposeful or conscious human activity, that
production (the transformation of the world by humans to meet their
needs) is guided and regulated consciously, then the distinctive essence
of \"welfare\" or \"humanity\" that gets stored in this container is the
specifically human power or ability to perform labor, i.e. labor power.
Thus labor power emerges as the alpha and the omega of the entire
reproductive circuit. The ultimate leitmotif of human activity proves to
be self referential in that the material reproduction of a society is
the recurrent production of labor power by means of labor power,
mediated by objective wealth and the rest of nature.

This exercise also helps to emphasize the following ideas:

1.  If the internal structure of society -- the set of reproductive
    interrelations (i.e. social relations of production) among the
    individual members -- does not get in the way, if the individual
    members of this community attain and sustain their cooperative
    unity, then the core of the material reproduction of society is and
    can only be the development of the productive force of labor of its
    individual members. Human development, the development of the
    universal powers of the individual members of society is the alpha
    and the omega of the whole reproductive circuit.

2.  The direct consumption process, the use of goods for the personal
    production of the individuals, is not what is specific of human
    societies. Other animal species must necessarily consume the objects
    they most immediately appropriate from their environment. Some
    animal species may transform the objects they directly appropriate
    from nature into objects that are more suitable to their needs, but
    this transformation is not viewed here as \"purposeful\" in the
    specific human sense. It is a fact that humans, through the
    development of language and symbolic (or abstract) thinking have a
    distinctive form of rationality that governs the ways in which
    humans interact with the rest of nature (and with one another).

3.  The development of production, as guided by labor, is an expanding
    sphere that appears as distinctively human. Historically, production
    has become a absolutely and relatively larger part of the
    reproduction circuit, becoming overwhelmingly dominant. It has
    become more \"round about\" (Alwyn Young's term) -- an ever
    lengthening chain of activities, reducing consumption, the direct
    personal use of goods, to the last link in the chain. This helps to
    dispel in the students the conventional notion of \"consumer
    sovereignty\" as governing economic principle.

4.  The consciousness inherent to collective labor is necessarily
    incorporated in the bodies of the producers (particularly in their
    nervous systems) and in the totality of objective wealth (especially
    in libraries, the Internet's physical media, etc., where it exists
    in its most directly communicable form).

5.  The conventional concept of \"technology\" or productive knowledge
    -- defined in economics textbooks as the \"information set\"
    containing (1) a description of finished outputs, (2) an exhaustive
    list and description of the inputs required under various production
    procedures (techniques), and (3) descriptions of the processes by
    which the inputs are to be combined to make the outputs under the
    various techniques -- can be reinterpreted in the broadest sense as
    the consciousness inherent to labor.
    
Common misconceptions are:

1.  The notion that all societies need private ownership over wealth,
    that production requires money as an input, or that hierarchies are
    necessarily inherent to society. The internal management of modern
    families, firms, and other organizations can be used to show that
    the allocation of resources (which this exercise to consist,
    ultimately, in a distribution of labor power, directly or
    indirectly) does not necessitate money or commodity exchange (trade)
    to be carried out. A college or university does not require that
    faculty members or students directly purchase the markers or erasers
    used in class. A mother does not require that her children purchase
    from her the milk they take from the family's refrigerator.

2.  The notion that technology is a separate input of production, that
    ideas exist in some separate Platonic world. In fact, technology can
    only exist in the physical world. If it did not exist in a physical
    medium or form, then it would not be of any consequence, because
    only physical objects can interact with other physical objects,
    human bodies included.

3.  Relatedly, that there are (i) \"intellectual\" (or \"spiritual\")
    production in which the output is ideal or immaterial and,
    separately, (ii) \"physical\" production in which the output is
    material or physical wealth. In fact, it can be shown to students,
    all production is necessarily physical, it must use physical inputs
    (labor power and means of production are physical). Also, all
    production necessarily incorporates labor which is conscious
    activity, and this consciousness or purpose is embodied in all
    produced wealth.

If we take all humans as a unit facing the rest of the nature, then
humans are on their own. can only reproduce ourselves by produce and
meet its own needs with its own resources.

It is, of course, possible for some individuals to subsist at the
expense of other individuals. But this cannot be true for all
individuals in society at once.

As a rule, societies considered as a totality must produce and consume
*wealth* continuously or recurrently, or risk extinction; and this is
true, regardless of their historical origin or institutional
characteristics. *Human* society regarded as a whole must necessarily
produce its own wealth.[^19]

[^19]: This does not mean, of course, that members of society must all
    produce at once, only that some must produce enough for all to
    consume. Children, the elderly, and the disabled may not be apt to
    take part in production. Society may have legal or ethical norms
    prohibiting or discouraging work in production for certain
    categories of people. Furthermore, at any given point in time, a
    fraction of society's labor force may be excluded from productive
    work as a result of social failures such as market disruptions,
    financial crises, political conflict, wars, etc.

Clearly, if people at a potluck dinner are to eat anything, then at
least one person should bring food. This chapter examines the conditions
that this fact imposes on our social life.

By assuming humans as united harmoniously to focus on the relation
between all humans and the rest of nature, the *internal* life of
society was deliberately ignored. Human society was regarded as endowed
with a single will, with its individual members pulling together in
unison, with no conflicting interests among its members.

This assumption implies that there is no meaningful distinction between
the wealth that society as a whole *has* and what its individual members
*own*. Instead, wealth is held by society as a whole, just like the
family's bathroom or refrigerator belongs to the entire family and not
to one particular individual member.

In subsequent chapters, by extension, the term *wealth* will also refer
to the stock of goods that one individual or particular group of
individuals *owns* at the exclusion of others. However, the notion of
exclusive or *private* ownership emerges only upon examination of the
internal structure of society.

One of the important results of the analysis of this chapter is that
private ownership is *not*, and cannot be regarded as, a *natural*
institution. It is human-made or artificial--though not necessarily
arbitrary. It is a historically-specific social structure. The
historical record shows that human societies proper, distinguishable
from groups of pre-human apes, have lived on earth for about a million
years. Private ownership proper only goes back in history thirteen or
fourteen centuries, to the time when civilized societies first emerged
in what is now known as the Middle East. Chapters x and xx will examine
the interactions among the individual members of society and show how
these interactions generate *social structures*. We will then see how
particular social structures may pit individuals (or groups of
individuals) against one another.

At first sight, *wealth* appears as a set of goods that society holds at
a given point in time.

According to the *Online Etymology Dictionary*, the term *wealth*
evolved from the word *wele*, a term used in England in the Middle Ages
to refer to *happiness*, *well-being*, or what economists today refer to
as *welfare*. Nowadays, people rarely use the term wealth as a
synonymous of welfare. Instead, they use it to designate "material
possessions" available for productive use or direct personal
consumption. Clearly, if the term *wealth* were used in its original
sense, then it would be redundant to say that wealth (or goods), when
used or consumed, increases welfare.

In other words, under this definition, wealth is a *stock* of
*goods*.[^21]

[^21]: \[CHAPTER\] discusses the distinction between *stock* and *flow*
    magnitudes.


Goods are objects that meet material human needs or wants, and as such
goods are the elementary components of wealth.

A good is defined as a discrete *object*. The totality of good is
wealth. This definition of a good may seem too narrow. Are there not
"intangible goods," goods such as information, friendship, or good will?
The nature of so-called "intangible goods" is clarified in \[SECTION\]
below.

Sometimes, it is convenient to say that goods are objects that when used
or consumed generate material *welfare* for individuals.[^22]

In turn, welfare can be simply defined as the well-being of individuals.
A more detailed discussion on the content of the term *welfare* follows
below.

[^22]: As an object, a good can be viewed as existing at a point in time.
    When used or consumed over time, goods provide a *material service*
    over a period of time. A material service then is a *flow*. Again,
    refer to \[CHAPTER\] for a detailed discussion of the stock-flow
    distinction. A material service is to be distinguished from a
    *socially necessary activity*. This distinction is similar to the
    one introduced above between *material needs* and *social
    necessities*. In our society, there is a host of activities that are
    necessary for the reproduction of specific social structures.
    Policing to enforce private ownership is a socially necessary
    activity, but it is not a material service.

    transformed the oil in these deposits into a product?

# SOCIAL COOPERATION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES

Introduction
============

The previous chapter focused on the relationship between the whole of
society and the rest of nature. It highlighted the ongoing metabolism
between society and the rest of nature, a process through which society
reproduces itself physically. By contrast, this chapter focuses on the
internal life of society, on how repeated cooperative interactions among
individuals lead to the formation of social relationships or *social
structures*. Two main types of social structures are distinguished. The
last part of the chapter is devoted to outlining the formation of chief
economic structures of a modern society: those of private ownership,
modern states and markets, and the way in which the historical formation
of global inequality overlaid on states and markets, led to the
emergence and development of capitalist economic structures, and with
them the extraordinarily rapid expansion of productivity and also social
instability and turbulence.

Social cooperation
==================

Societies are other than a multiplicity of individuals. The interaction
among them -- their recurrent cooperation to be more specific -- is the
basis of all social life.

Individuals either interact or engage with one another -- or not. If
they do not, they may simply withdraw from one another, or they may even
enter into outright conflict. Repeated engagement, cooperation in
particular, forms society. Withdrawal and, worse, conflict unravel
society.

When individuals cooperate in various ways, and they do so in a repeated
or stable manner, then they form more or less permanent social
structures. A concrete society or social formation is a complex ensemble
of social structures.

Cooperation can be simply defined as interactive human activity in which
individuals help one another. To help one another, individuals require
sharing some common purpose or design, and then acting collectively to
realize it.

People may help others accomplish their designs without expecting much
or anything in return from them, more or less selflessly. One may call
this type of cooperation noninstrumental or direct.

Thus, *direct cooperation* is cooperation for its own sake, unilateral
or mutual help among neighbors or friends, by a mother caring for her
baby. A host of crucial social institutions that have formed
historically under the mos diversed conditions, one can find families,
clans, tribes, city states, nation states, clubs, churches, business
firms, etc.[^1]

In contrast, individuals may help one another moved by the expectation
of the beneficiaries of their help helping them in turn -- immediately
or in the future. One may call this type of cooperation instrumental,
self-regarding or indirect.

[^1]: http://nyti.ms/5DAldO 

Thus, *indirect cooperation* is cooperation for one's own sake, *quid
pro quo*. Examples of this type of cooperation are those that lead to
the formation of a state, in which people have mutual expectations (e.g.
tax payment, shared protection, etc.), market exchange, etc.

This is the logic of "I scratch your back if you scratch mine." In the
case of market exchange or trade, it is the logic of "I scratch your
back only if you scratch mine in accordance to the rate of mutual back
scratching dictated by market prices."

In sum, the life of a society is always -- necessarily -- based on the
cooperation among individuals. We can only produce, work, and live in
cooperation -- even when and if it doesn't seem like it.

Depending on the prevailing form of cooperation, one may distinguish
between two extreme types of social structures: social organisms and
social organizations. Social organisms are more or less spontaneously
form, without any of its participant individuals having, beforehand, a
clear design of the final look and feel of the organism. In the case of
social organisms, order and coherence are spontaneous or accidental
results of the collision among multiple individual wills, none of which
exercises control over the organism.

Social organizations are conceived, planned, and then undertaken in
practice more or less in accordance to a plan. In the case of social
organizations, improvisation and on-the-spot adjustment in response to
unexpected circumstances, are secondary to the overall design.

Instances of social organizations or, more simply, organizations are
families or, more generally, households from the viewpoint of parents or
partners taking the initiative to form them. Proto-states (from extended
families to clans to tribes) and states (from city-states to national
states to multinational states), as well political and civic formations
are examples of organizations. One can also mention business firms.

Organizations have a "unified command center" and, thus, make relatively
coherent choices, as if they were healthy individuals. Control by a
central will may or may not be easy to attain in an organization, but
there is the clear intent to exercise it.

Instances of social organisms are families or households from the
viewpoint of children, markets, mobs, spontaneously formed crowds,
cities or towns in their earlier formation.

Again, social organisms exhibit behavior that may appear or be orderly,
but they lack a "unified command center," so the orderly or disorderly
behavior of the organism results from the aggregation of mutually
conflicting choices made by the individual members of the organism.

Private ownership, trade, markets
=================================

Trade is a form of social cooperation.

Trade is self-regarding cooperation.

Upside: May unleash individual productivity and creativity.

Downside: May weaken social bonds, especially in the presence of gaping
inequality.

Upside or downside shift depending on conditions.

Trade presupposes private ownership.

Private ownership:

Economics Law Ideology An economy with markets and government

Productivity under capitalism

Trade, markets, and capitalism

Trade is trade of financial "securities" (legal claims of ownership over
goods)

Money is a highly acceptable financial claim

Markets connect other social structures (households, firms, states)

Use of private wealth for profit goes back to ancient times

Capitalism: markets + inequality (wage labor)

Horizontal cooperation

Simple cooperation

Division of labor and specialization

Mechanization and industrialization

Automation and digital technology

Division of labor

Labor is purposeful human activity

To accomplish any purpose, labor has to be divided:

At each point in time or for each period of time

By individual

Yet, at the end of the day, we need labor to unite

The labor of society is divided by task, function, age, sex/gender,
occupation, industry, sector, nation

Division of labor

Uniting the divided labor is cooperating

Cooperation entails sharing (at least) a purpose

Cooperation usually requires that workers share productive inputs
(natural resources, means of production)

Divisibility of labor, specialization, freeing time to save labor

Mechanization

Machines have (1) a motor or engine, (2) a transmission mechanism, and
(3) a tool or set of tools attached to it that operates on the labor's
object (instead of directly using the hands)

Simple tools: the motor or engine is human or animal. Advanced tools:
the motive force is water, wind, steam, internal combustion,
electricity, etc.

Mechanization builds on labor division and cooperation

Automation

Automata have (1) a programmable control system and (2) a machine or set
of machines controlled or regulated by it

Advanced automata use modern information (digital) technology. Computers
(programmable digital machines) are being used as universal control
systems.

Vertical cooperation

Methods of hierarchical cooperation:

Force or threat thereof Deprivation of basic necessities (land,
consumption goods) "Enlightened" self-interest Psychological
manipulation Horizontal cooperation: Rational persuasion between equals
Democracy at the workplace, polity, etc.

Summary
=======

Societies are based on cooperation among individuals Social structures
(organizations and organisms) result from cooperation Trade is a form of
social cooperation, with pluses and minuses Trade requires other forms
of social cooperation Productivity expanded as labor division led to
mechanization and automation Vertical cooperation has been the rule in
the last few thousand years of history Do we need more horizontal
cooperation and less vertical now? Is it possible?

[**VARIABLES, ABSOLUTE & RELATIVE CHANGE (%)**]{.sans-serif}

Introduction
============

These notes review the concept of a variable, defines its change (in
absolute and percentage terms), and shows how to compute them.

Concept of a variable
=====================

A *variable* is a mathematical concept that designates a *quality*,
*property*, or *aspect* of the world subject to change that is of
interest to us. The phrase "subject to change" in the prior sentence was
not really necessary, since most everything in the universe appears to
be subject to change or variation.

Consider a few examples of different types of variables:

**Categorical or nominal variables**: The first name of a man, which can
take particular values such as "John," "Carlos," "Abdul," etc. The color
of a flower, which can take values such as "Red," "Yellow," "Purple,"
etc. The race or ethnicity of a group of people, which can take values
such as "White," "Black," "Hispanic," "Asian," etc.

A categorical or nominal variable has values that cannot, inherently, be
ordered in any meaningful way. They can be ordered by reference to
another variable, but that is not "inherent." Also, they can be ordered
alphabetically, but that is not particularly meaningful.

**Ordinal variables**: The answers to a survey question on political
preferences, which can take particular values such as "Extreme Right,"
"Moderate Right," "Moderate," "Moderate Left," "Extreme Left." Or the
answers to a survey question on customer satisfaction: "Very satisfied,"
"Satisfied," "Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied," "Dissatisfied," "Very
dissatisfied."

Ordinal variables are those whose values can be ordered, but the
"spacing" or "distance" between the values may not be the same from one
to its next in order.

It should be clear that variables as those in the examples above are not
amenable to arithmetic manipulation. We may compare two names or colors
categorically, but we will not be able to reach any conclusion on
whether one name or color is "greater than" or "less than" another name
or color. The values of ordinal variables can be ordered as "first,"
"second," "third," etc., but there is no way to know whether the
difference between the values "first" and "second" is the same as the
difference between the values "second" and "third," etc.

Some times we denote a variable by a symbol, such as $x$, that within a
given theoretical framework or model can take more than one particular
value. This is especially convenient when we are dealing with *cardinal
variables*, like the variables shown in the following examples.[^1]

Here is a bunch of examples of cardinal variables:

-   The age of a college student, $x$, where
    $x = 18, 19, \ldots, 35, \ldots$.

-   The unemployment rate, $u \in (0, 1)$, where $u=0$ means that there
    are no unemployed workers and $u=1$ means that the entire labor
    force is unemployed. The expression $u \in (0, 1)$ reads as: "The
    values of $u$ belong in the interval with endpoints $0$ and $1$,
    where the endpoints are not possible values of $u$."

-   The price of milk in the local market, $p > 0$ (in dollars per
    gallon). Thus, on May 10, 2013, $p=\$3.12/$gallon.

-   The median annual income of households in New York State, $y_t > 0$
    (in thousands of dollars), where $t=2008-2009, 2010-2011$ is another
    variable (called a time index) denoting the year. Thus,
    $y_{2010-2011}=\$56,950$.[^2]

-   The median annual income of a household in a given state, $y_i > 0$
    (in dollars), where $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 50$ is another variable (a
    state index) indicating the state and where the codes are
    $1=$Alabama, $2=$Alaska, $\ldots$, $50=$Wyoming. Thus, in 2011,
    $y_1=42,407$ is the 2011 median household annual income in Alabama,
    $y_2=58,552$ in Alaska, $\ldots$, $y_{50}=54,178$ in Wyoming.[^3]

-   The annual gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) in a given
    country, $y_{it} > 0$ (in current U.S. dollars per person), where
    $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 214$ is the country index with codes
    $1=$Afghanistan, $2=$Albania, $\ldots$, $214=$Zimbabwe, and
    $t=60, 61, \ldots, 11$ denotes the year. Thus, $y_{1, 60=55.61}$ is
    the 1960 GDPPC in Afghanistan, $y_{2, 84=665.60}$ is the 1984 GDPPC
    in Albania, $\ldots$, $y_{214, 11}=757.09$ is the 2011 GDPPC in
    Zimbabwe.[^4]

Again, cardinal variables take numerical values that can be ordered and
manipulated arithmetically. The following discussion on variables refers
to cardinal ones only.

Absolute change
===============

If we know the value of a variable at different points in time (or for
different periods of time), we can then determine the *absolute change*
(change, for short) of its value from one point in time (or period of
time) to another.

**Absolute change**: The **absolute change** (or, for short, the
*change*) of a variable $x$ is the difference between two of its values.
We conventionally call one of its values the *initial value* and the
other one its *final value*.

For example: The change in the height of a student, from Peter to John.
The change in Peter's height over a year.

Note that the change of a variable may be *cross-sectional* (across
categories) or *temporal* (over time), from one point in time (or period
of time) to the next: $$\begin{aligned}
\Delta x_t = x_t - x_{t-1},\label{eqn:change}\end{aligned}$$ where the
capital Greek letter $\Delta$ indicates absolute change and $t$
indicates the time point (or period).

When the change in a variable $x$ is greater than $0$, $\Delta x > 0$,
we say that $x$ increased. When $\Delta x < 0$, we say that $x$
decreased. When $\Delta x = 0$, we say that there was no change.

Here is an example that illustrates the concept of *change*:

**Absolute change in a boy's height**: On December 15, 2010, the height
of a boy is 100 centimeters. On December 15, 2011, it is 118
centimeters. With these data we may determine the change in the boy's
height. Let $t = 0$ indicate the date December 15, 2010 and $t=1$ the
date December 15, 2011. Then, $x_0 = 100$ and $x_1 = 118$. We read this
information as: "The level of $x$ at $t=0$ is 100 and 118 at $t=1$." We
substitute in
equation [\[eqn:change\]](#eqn:change){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:change"} to determine the change in $x$:
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta x_1 = x_1 - x_0 = 118 - 100 = 18.\end{aligned}$$ In words, the
annual change in the boy's height is 18 centimeters. Or, the boy's
height increased in 18 centimeters from December 15, 2010 to the same
date in 2008.

[R]{.sans-serif} code
---------------------

\<\<\>\>= x0 \<- 100 x1 \<- 118 dx \<- (x1 - x0) dx @

Percent change
==============

**Percent change**: The **percent change** or *relative change* of a
variable $x$ is defined as its absolute change expressed as a proportion
of its initial value: $$\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}=\frac{\Delta x_t}{x_{t-1}} = \frac{x_t - x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}},\label{eqn:perchange}\end{aligned}$$
where the "hat" \^ on top of a variable's symbol indicates its percent
change.

When the percent change of a variable $x$ is positive, $\hat{x} > 0$, we
say that $x$ grew. When $\hat{x} < 0$, we say that $x$ decayed. When
$\hat{x} = 0$, we say that $x$ stagnated.

When a percent change refers to change *over time*, it is often called
*growth rate*. Note that the change in the value of a variable is not
necessarily change over time. For example: The variable *milk price*
today may change from its value in Brooklyn to its value in Queens. To
distinguish it from growth or change *over time*, we call this
*cross-sectional change*.

To illustrate the need for the concept of percent change, consider the
following examples:

During 2010, John was a senior college student working part time at
McBurgers, where his income totaled \$10,000. During 2011, John worked
for an economic consulting firm as a junior analyst and his annual
income amounted to \$50,000. The change in in John's 2010 income to its
2011 income (in thousands of dollars, with zeros and signs omitted):
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta y^J_1 = y^J_1 - y^J_0 = 50 - 10 = 40,\end{aligned}$$ where
$y^i_t$ indicates individual $i$'s annual income in year $t$ (abreviated
to its last digit).

Now consider Mary, a lawyer at a Wall Street firm, who had annual
incomes of \$400,000 in 2010 and \$440,000 in 2011. The change in Mary's
annual income from 2010 to 2011 (again, in thousands of dollars) was:
$$\begin{aligned}
y^M_1 = y^M_1 - y^M_0 = 440 - 400 = 40.\end{aligned}$$

Now compare John and Mary. Their 2011 change in annual income was the
same, \$40,000. However, it would not feel right to say that both John
and Mary had a similar experience. John started from a much lower income
in 2010 and his \$40,000 increase in annual income represents a dramatic
turnaround in his life. Mary was already making a hefty income in 2010
and an additional income of \$40,000, while not negligible, did not
alter her professional status significantly. If we only look at the
change in income without putting things in the context of their initial
or 2010 annual incomes, it would seem as if both experienced the same.
How do we capture the significantly different experiences that John and
Mary had between 2010 and 2011?

We express their changes in annual income as percentages of their
initial (2010) income. The result is the percent change or growth rate
of their annual incomes. Thus, for John: $$\begin{aligned}
\hat{y}^J_1 = \frac{\Delta y^J_1}{y^J_0} = \frac{40}{10} = 4 = 400\%\end{aligned}$$

In words, "John's annual income grew by 400 per cent" or "John's annual
income quadrupled between 2006 and 2007." For Mary: $$\begin{aligned}
\hat{y}^M_1 = \frac{\Delta y^M_1}{y^M_0} = \frac{40}{400} = 4 = 10\%\end{aligned}$$

In words, "Mary's annual income grew by 10%" or "Mary's annual income
increased by one tenth over the year."

Again, the percentage change in John's annual income is *over time*,
rather than cross-sectional, and that is why we call it *growth rate*. A
cross-sectional percent change would be the difference between John's
and Mary's annual income levels for a given (the same) year expressed as
a percentage of any one of them.

We could have put in perspective the change in John or Mary's annual
income dividing it by the final (2011) annual income level or by some
average between the annual income levels in 2010 and 2011, rather than
dividing it by the initial or 2010 annual income level. As long as we
are consistent in the denominator we use, the interpretation of the
results should be straightforward. Although there are some exceptions
(such as the calculation of elasticities using the *mid-point method*),
most often, when economists refer to percentage changes or growth rates,
they refer to changes in the variable of interest divided by the level
of the variable at the initial point.

In economics, the numerical value of a variable is often called its
*level* or magnitude. The level is to be distinguished from its absolute
change, or *change* for short, and from its percent change or growth
rate, often shortened to the *growth* of the variable.

Students should be very careful about whether a particular symbol
denotes the "level" of a variable, or its "change," or its "growth."
Note that, depending on the sign of the change, the growth rate can be
positive (growth proper) or negative (also called "decay"). Also crucial
is the specification of the units in which a given variable is measured.
For more on this, see the section on stocks and flows.

As an exercise, create four examples of absolute and relative (or
percentage) change, and submit your work as intra credit.

Introduction
============

To take purposeful action, humans need to anticipate consequences. Since
we people act as physical forces in the physical world and in society,
and our actions collide with other forces of nature, including the
actions of other people, for our actions to be deliberate, we need to
sort out causes and effects. In other words, we need to build in our
minds theories or models of the structures and processes in the reality
in which we are immersed so we can best manage.

"What causes the price of oil to drop?" "What causes unemployment to
increase?" "What kind of policies will increase the growth rate of an
economy by one percent over the long run?" These are questions that
concern economists.

Ascertaining cause-effect relationships is particularly difficult in
economics, because controlled experiments tend to be either very
expensive or impracticable. Since our main theoretical tool is
abstraction, symbolic reasoning, our ability to manipulate concepts
logically, then we must pay close attention to the logical consistency
of our arguments.

These notes introduce the notion of an economic theory or model as well
the mathematical concepts that may help us specify the connections
between various aspects of our economic life: functions (multivariate
and bivariate) and their main types.

Theories or models
==================

A model or theory is a simplified description of some phenomenon of
interest built in order to rationalize, make sense of, or understand
such phenomenon.

Formally, a model or theory is a reasoning or chain of logical
statements of the type: "IF $X$, THEN $Y$," where $X$ is the set of
premises, assumptions, hypotheses, or postulates of the model, $Y$ is
the set of conclusions, results, consequences, predictions, or
implications of the model, and $Y$ follows logically (e.g.
mathematically) from $X$.

All models have that form. For example, a fashion model (see Figure
[1](#p:mod){reference-type="ref" reference="p:mod"}. Clearly, a fashion
model is not like oneself. She or he can look very different from us.
Yet, what a fashion model parading down the runway shows us is what we
would look like if only we had a body and face like her or him and
dressed alike. That is, if the premise set is accepted, then the
conclusion set follows and is, therefore, warranted.

![Fashion models \[©Walterlan Papetti\]](images/model.jpg){#p:mod
width="5cm"}

The premises contain the conclusions, because no thing can result from
nothing. The conclusions are already lodged in the premises, but they
are not apparent. If they were obvious, then the model would be silly or
tautological (Google that word). It still takes an effort for the human
mind to extract the conclusions logically from the premises. The
conclusions may appear obvious to us, but only after we have become so
familiar with the model that its structure and results seem trivial to
us.

Learning about the world, mentally appropriating it, involves a
trade-off. One's body, or even the bodies of all humans taken together,
is a tiny subset of the universe. The universe cannot fit fully into
one's head. We need to compress it tightly, filtering out what one deems
unimportant or irrelevant, and focusing on what one regards as
essential.

One cannot make any significant progress in cognition if she is not
willing to break up a complicated phenomenon into its component parts,
examine each of these parts in turn as if they existed separately, and
then try and reconstitute the whole, though now in an organized and
understood manner.

In reality, everything seems to be related to everything else. But we
cannot take in all things at once. We can only focus on one or a few
things at a time. That is why one must necessarily assume, as a
provisional step in cognition, that the parts can be separated from the
whole, studied on their own. When one pretends that some part exists in
itself, outside of its relationship to the whole phenomenon, one is
already dealing with an abstraction.

An abstraction is an aspect of the world, but since it is an aspect
taken apart from the aspects, then it can only be light or sketchy in
its content. It is only by reintegrating it with the rest of the whole
that an abstraction gains detail, specificity, etc., and becomes
concrete.

Truth, insofar as one can approximate it, is concrete organized
knowledge. To get any closer to concrete organized knowledge, one starts
from abstractions, carefully selected ones, general concepts that, at
first, are largely empty of particular, concrete content. Gradually, as
one's familiarity with the parts of the phenomenon and with the form in
which these parts form the whole increases, these notions become more
concrete and realistic, and therefore more useful to guide one's
practical actions in the world.

Thus, building abstract models or replicas of concrete phenomena is a
valid step in cognition. These replicas are necessarily simpler than the
phenomenon they aim to depict. One can only learn about the world by
reducing the unknown to what is already familiar. This is another way of
saying that one needs to reduce complex phenomena to simpler analogs. No
give, no take, like no pain, no gain.

It is silly to say that an abstraction or idea is not identical with the
aspect world it seeks to depict. Similarly, it is silly to say that
theory and practice are different. Of course they are! But there's
nothing more practical---more practically powerful---than a good theory,
just like there is nothing more concrete than a good, properly chosen
abstraction.

If the model is too complex, then one is back to square one. Models that
are too complex cannot help us see the light. They have so many parts
moving in our minds that we are incapable of obtaining from them
straight answers. Complex models leave us confused. To be tractable,
models need to be simple so our minds are lucid.

However, the ultimate goal of our modelling exercises is practical. We
need to solve practical problems, intervene in the world successfully.
That requires that the results or conclusions of the model be
sufficiently realistic. We are cutting some corners in our theorizing,
but if we cut too many of them (or the important ones), then the results
are not going to help us much.

If the premises are less realistic, then the conclusions will also be
less realistic. Yet, if the premises are too realistic, then the model
becomes more complex, almost as complex as the phenomenon we are trying
to figure out and manage. That defeats the purpose of having a model.

In brief, there is a relative conflict between the realism of a model
and its tractability. We need models that are useful, which requires
that they be somewhat realistic, but we need our models not to be so
realistic that they become intractable, impossible for us to figure out.

Again, the ultimate purpose of building an economic model is to,
ultimately, guide one's practical choices. In microeconomics, a business
manager uses a model of a firm's activity to make choices about how to
minimize costs or maximize profits given certain restrictions (e.g.
technology, input prices, competition, laws). In macroeconomics, a
policymaker (e.g. the Federal Reserve) uses a model of the economy to
make choices about how to manipulate credit conditions to boost
employment or reduce inflation. Etc.

Typically, an economic model has a set of endogenous variables. An
endogenous variable represents, for example, the state of the firm's
finances (e.g. costs, profits, etc.) or the state of the economy (e.g.
income level, productivity, employment, inflation rate, etc.). This
variable is endogenous because the model is going to help us determine
its approximate level or value.

The model also has exogenous variables, those that the model takes as
given. Usually, one needs to designate the variables that one directly
controls or manages as exogenous, since one would like to retain the
freedom to choose them on the basis of their effects on the endogenous
variables as predicted by the model.

Also, some exogenous "variables" may represent some relatively *stable*
or constant features of the world depicted in the model. These
relatively fixed "variables" (or, perhaps more properly, "constants")
are referred as the parameters of the model.

Deciding which variables should be endogenous and which exogenous (and
then which ones have the stability to be considered as parameters) is an
art in economics. It depends on what the practical questions are that
the model must help to answer. It requires some experience and
judiciousness.

Some models serve a general theoretical purpose to guide our intuitions
and do not need to give us precise quantitative answers. Other models
are built to help us anticipate not only the direction but also the
magnitude of the effects of changes in the exogenous variables. In this
case, once the model is built, one needs to "calibrate" it with
real-world data so it can provide us with specific quantitative answers.

Let us now turn to the mathematical machinery involved in economic
models.

Multivariate functions
======================

Usually, economic events of interest result from multiple causes.
However, if many of these causes are minor and if---to some
extent---they offset one another, then it is possible for economists to
find simpler yet powerful explanations, i.e. explanations that isolate a
few though important causes, especially those that---aside from being
important---are under the control or conscious influence of individuals,
organizations, or governments.

In mathematical terms, we say that most (if not all) economic phenomena
are the result of relationships between multiple variables. We specify
these relations by means of *functions*. In mathematics, a function is a
*relation* between two sets---the *input* set (or *domain*) and the
*output* set (or *codomain*)---and denoted as follows:

A **function** $f$ is a relation between the domain set $X$ and the
codomain set $Y$. $$\begin{aligned}
f: X \rightarrow Y.\end{aligned}$$

The elements of $X$ are called the arguments of the function. The
element $y$ of codomain set $Y$ that corresponds to a given element $x$
of domain set $X$ is called the *value* of the function or the *image*
of $x$ under the function $f$.

If we restrict both sets to the real numbers, then we usually denote a
function as: $$\begin{aligned}
y = f(x),\end{aligned}$$

an object that one can perhaps plot in a graph.

There are many ways to describe this with words. This is the common way
in which theoretical economists refer to $y=f(x)$: "$f$ maps each value
of $x$ to a unique value of $y$."

Although mathematicians introduce very subtle distinctions between these
terms, for our purposes the terms *relation*, *function*,
*transformation*, or *mapping* will be treated here as synonymous or
interchangeable.

Let us define now a very general functional specification that will
cover a lot of cases of interest to us:

The relation between a variable and a host of other variables can be
represented by a **multivariate function**: $$\begin{aligned}
y = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n),\end{aligned}$$ where $y$ is called the
*dependent variable*, $f(.)$ means "a function of" the *arguments* of
the function (the variables in parenthesis), that is, the *independent
variables* $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where $n$ can be any positive whole
number. That $y$ is "a function of" the independent variables $x_i$ (for
$i=1, \ldots, n$) means that its value or level depends on the values or
levels of the independent variables. The function $f(.)$, once
specified, is descriptive of the type of relationship between the
dependent and the independent variables.

The variables on the right hand side of the expression above are called
"independent" because they are regarded as largely unrelated to one
another. In fact, in the universe, everything seems to be interrelated
with everything else, one way or another. However, some of these
interrelations are more immediate or direct than others. This is why,
forcing things a little, one can frame things this way.

Now, from a mathematical viewpoint, that $y$ is a function of $x_i$ does
*not* mean that $x_i$ *causes* $y$: A multivariate function does not
imply that the independent variables $x_i$ (for $i=1, \ldots, n$) are
the *causes* of the dependent variable $y$. In other words, it does not
imply that changes in their values *cause* the value of the dependent
variable to change in accordance to the rule $f(.)$. The function only
says that there is some definite *relationship* between $y$ and $x_i$
(for $i=1, \ldots, n$), so that when some $x_i$ changes, $y$ also
changes according to rule $f(.)$.

Conventionally, the function suggests that theorists believes that $y$
is the *effect* and $x_i$ (for $i=1, \ldots, n$) the *cause*. However,
the function itself does not imply that this is necessarily the case.
Under the function, $x_i$ *may* cause $y$, $y$ may cause some or all
$x_i$, or both $y$ and $x_i$ may be caused by some other variable not
identified in the expression. In a theory, the economist must postulate
the direction of causality independently from this mathematical
expression. The mathematical statement is used only to get a better
sense of the logic involved.

Bivariate functions
===================

Since dealing with multivariate functions mathematically can get very
complicated very quickly, in this textbook we assume that there is only
one independent variable of interest. All other independent variables
are assumed to be *constant* or "given." This assumption is needed so we
focus on one independent variable $x$ at a time.

This should not be viewed as a terrible sacrifice. It is easier for us
to grasp things with only one moving part at a time, while the other
parts are assumed fixed. In logic, when we imagine that everything else
remains constant to focus on the relationship between only two
variables, we are making the *caeterius paribus* assumption.[^1]

This assumption effectively reduces multivariate functions to bivariate
functions. A relationship involving two variables can be represented by
a *bivariate function*: $$\begin{aligned}
y = f(x),\end{aligned}$$

Again, $y$ is the dependent variable and $x$ the (single) independent
variable. The equation says that as $x$ varies, $y$ varies in accordance
with rule $f(.)$.

Bivariate functions are very convenient to work with, since we may
represent them graphically on a plane---a flat space split by two
perpendicular lines, a vertical axis and a horizontal one, each axis
representing a variable. This way we gain a visual understanding of the
relationship between the two variables.

Conventionally, we plot the values of $x$ on the horizontal axis and the
values of $y$ on the vertical axis. Each axis is a number line and each
pair of values $(x, y)$ corresponds to a point in the plane: a point's
projection on the horizontal axis is the value $x$ and its projection on
the vertical axis is the value $y$.

Identity function
-----------------

We now study the simplest types of bivariate functions. The very
simplest (somewhat trivial) case of a bivariate function is the
**identity function**: $$\begin{aligned}
y = x.\end{aligned}$$

In words, whenever $x$ takes a value, then $y$ takes that same value.

Assigning values to $x$ and using those values to determine the
corresponding values of $y$ as given by the function is called
*evaluating* the function. When we evaluate bivariate functions, we
generate data tables with two columns, one column with the values of $x$
and the other one with the values of $y$. To plot the graph, we need at
least two values of $x$, which by using the equation $y = x$, yield two
corresponding values for $y$.

**Example**: Evaluating the identity function: Since $y = x$, then, if
$x=-2$, then $y=x=2$ or $y=2$. Also, if $x=5$, then $y=5$.

Table [1](#t:ident){reference-type="ref" reference="t:ident"}, which you
can easily complete, displays some selected values of $x$ and $y$:

::: {#t:ident}
    $x$   $y=x$

     -2      -2
     -1 
      0       0

      2 
      3       3
      4 

  : The identity function: $y=x$
:::

With these figures, we have sufficient information to plot the graph of
this function, which is a straight line that goes through these points.
In this case (the identity function), the line also goes through the
origin (i.e. the point where $x = 0$ and $y = 0$).

Use <https://www.desmos.com/> to graph the identity function $y = x$ and
all the other functions discussed below. Or, if you prefer, use
<https://www.google.com/>. Play with the parameters of these graphs.
While these tools are handy, make sure you feel comfortable plotting
these graphs manually with pen on paper.

Figure [\[f:id\]](#f:id){reference-type="ref" reference="f:id"} is my
own plot of the identity function:

Proportional function
---------------------

The **proportional function** has the following form: $$\begin{aligned}
y = b x,\end{aligned}$$ where $b$ is a "parameter" indicating some given
or constant number.

Here is an example of a proportional function: $$\begin{aligned}
y = 3 x,\end{aligned}$$ where $b=3$. In words, $y$ is always the triple
of $x$. Thus, if $x = 10$, then $y = 3 \times 10 = 30$. Table
[2](#t:prop){reference-type="ref" reference="t:prop"} shows in tabular
form some (fill in the blanks) numerical values of $x$ and $y$:

::: {#t:prop}
    $x$   $y=3 x$
  ----- ---------
     -2        -6
     -1 
      0         0
      1 
      2 
      3         9
      4 

  : A proportional function: $y=3 x$
:::

A good economic example of a proportional function follows. Currency
conversion at a given *exchange rate* illustrates the use of the
proportional function in economics. Suppose that today's U.S.
dollar-Mexican peso exchange rate is 10 Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar.
Then, algebraically: $$\begin{aligned}
y = 10 x,\end{aligned}$$ where $x$ is an amount of money denominated in
U.S. dollars and $y$ is its equivalent amount in Mexican pesos. If, for
example, the amount in U.S. dollars is $x=25$, then the equivalent
amount in pesos is $y = 10 \times 25 = 250$.

What is the reverse exchange rate, i.e. the Mexican peso-U.S. dollar
exchange rate? In other words, how many dollars are the market
equivalent of one Mexican peso?

As another example, let the exchange rate of U.S. dollars into euros be
.9 euro per U.S. dollar. The graph of this function is shown in Figure
[\[f:prop\]](#f:prop){reference-type="ref" reference="f:prop"}.
Determine the equivalent amount in euros of 327 U.S. dollars.
Algebraically: $$\begin{aligned}
y = .9 \ x,\end{aligned}$$ where---again---$x$ is the amount in U.S.
dollars and $y$ is the equivalent in euros. We evaluate this function
for $x=327$: $y = .9 x = .9 \times 327 = 294.3$. In words, 327 U.S.
dollars is equivalent to 294.3 euros.

Note that the examples are simple. They are meant to illustrate general
concepts. Students should try with more complicated numbers.

The constant "parameter" $b$ is called the *slope* of the function, and
it indicates the *scale* at which $y$ expands or shrinks as $x$ changes.
Graphically, $b$ determines the inclination (or "slope") of the linear
graph representing $y = b x$. More formally, the slope $b$ indicates the
change in $y$ when $x$ changes in one unit: $$\begin{aligned}
b=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_2},\end{aligned}$$

where the subindex indicates the initial ($0$) or final ($1$) value of a
variable. To show this result, let $x_1=0$ and $x_1=3$. Therefore:
$y_0 = b x_0 = b \times 0 = 0$ and $y_1 = b x_1 = b \times 3 = 3 b$. The
changes in the variables are, respectively,
$\Delta x = x_1 - x_0 = 3 - 0 = 3$ and
$\Delta y = y_1 - y_0 = 3 b - 0 = 3 b$. We then note that:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{3 b}{3} = b.\end{aligned}$$

To double check the result, let $x_0 = 10$ and $x_1 = 50$. Therefore:
$y_0 = b x_0 = b \times 10 = 10 b$ and
$y_1 = b x_1 = b \times 50 = 50 b$. The changes in the variables are,
respectively, $\Delta x = x_1 - x_0 = 50 - 10 = 40$ and
$\Delta y = y_1 - y_0 = 50 b - 10 b = 40 b$. We note that:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{40 b}{40} = b.\end{aligned}$$

Again, the slope $b$ indicates the change in $y$ when $x$ changes by
one.

When $b = 1$ the proportional function becomes ("degenerates" or
simplifies to) the identity function. In other words, the identity
function is the proportional function in the particular case when
$b = 1$.

Here is an exercise for you to evaluate a proportional function: Let
$y = 4.5 x$. Evaluate this function for $x_0=2.2$ and $x_1=3.2$,
construct a data table, and then graph the function.

Linear function
---------------

Consider now a more general function. The **linear function** is defined
as, $$\begin{aligned}
y = a + b x,\end{aligned}$$ where $a$ and $b$ are both "parameters"
indicating given or constant numbers.

As noted above, the *slope* $b$ shows how steep or shallow the linear
graph is and it indicates the change in $y$ associated with a
unit-change in $x$: $$\begin{aligned}
b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.\end{aligned}$$

The constant "parameter" $a$ is called the vertical intercept or,
simply, the *intercept*, because it determines the location of the graph
in the plane. More specifically, $a$ determines the point at which the
linear graph crosses the vertical axis. The intercept $a$ can be
positive or negative. If $a > 0$, then the linear graph crosses the
vertical axis above the origin (on the positive region of $y$). If
$a < 0$, then the linear graph crosses the vertical axis below the
origin (on the negative region of $y$). If $a=0$, then the linear graph
crosses the vertical axis at the origin (at $y=0$).

The proportional function is a "degenerate" case of the linear function.
In other words, the proportional function is a linear function when a =
0: $$\begin{aligned}
y = a + b x = b x,\end{aligned}$$ if $a=0$. Again, graphically, when
$a = 0$, the line crosses the vertical axis at the origin, that is, when
$y = 0$.

Another example follows. The formula to convert from the Celsius
temperature scale to the Farenheit scale is: $$\begin{aligned}
y = 32 + \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) x,\end{aligned}$$ where $x$
temperature in the Celsius scale and $y$ is its equivalent in the
Farenheit scale.

In Celsius, the water begins to freeze at 0 degrees or when $x=0$. In
Farenheit, the "freezing point" is $y = 32 + (9/5) 0 = 32$. The
intercept $a=32$ immediately gives us the needed information: Water
begins to freeze at 32 degrees Farenheit.

On the other hand, the water begins to boil at 100 degrees Celsius. For
$x=100$, $y=32 + (9/5) x = 32 + [(9/5) \times 100] = 32 + 180 = 212$.
The water begins to boil at 212 degrees Farenheit.

If $b > 0$ (positive slope), then the change in $y$ associated with the
unit-change in $x$ is positive. In other words, there is a *positive* or
*direct relationship* between $x$ and $y$. If $b < 0$ (negative slope),
then the change in $y$ associated with the unit-change in $x$ is
negative. That is, there is a *negative* or *inverse relationship*
between $x$ and $y$.

If $b = 0$, then no matter how much $x$ changes, $y$ does not change at
all: the graph is a flat or horizontal line. However, if
$b \rightarrow \infty$, then even the tiniest change in $x$ will send
$y$ through the roof. In other words, the graph would become a vertical
line.

The linear **consumption function**, which we will study later in the
course, offers a good example. Let, $Y$ be *income* and $C$ *consumption
spending* (or "consumption" for short), both in monetary units and for a
given period of time. Consider the data in Table
[3](#t:cfn){reference-type="ref" reference="t:cfn"} for selected levels
of $Y$ and $C$, in monetary units not indicated to avoid cluttering text
and table. (Fill in the blanks.):

  : A linear consumption function: $C = a + b Y$
:::

The visual inspection of the data shows that there is a linear
relationship between $Y$ and $C$. From one row to the next, $Y$
increases by 100 and, as a result, $C$ increases by 50. By taking data
from any couple of rows, we can then determine the slope of this
relationship. Let us take two rows with proper data: $Y_0 = 0, C_0 = 50$
and $Y_1 = 400, C_1 = 250$. Therefore, the changes are, respectively,
$\Delta Y = Y_1 - Y_0 = 400 - 0 = 400$ and
$\Delta C = C_1 - C_0 = 250 - 50 = 200$. The slope is then:
$$b = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y} = \frac{200}{400} = 0.5.$$

With this information, we know that the relationship between income and
consumption is given by: $$\begin{aligned}
C = a + 0.5 Y.\end{aligned}$$

However, we still ignore the value of intercept $a$. To determine $a$
and completely specify our (linear) consumption function we need
information that any one row in the table can give us. Let us use the
second row. Hence $C = a + 0.5 Y$ is evaluated as:
$100 = a + (0.5 \times 100) = a + 50$. This is a simple linear equation,
which we can solve for $a$ by subtracting 50 from each side of the
equation: $100 - 50 = a = 50$. We got it! $a = 50$. The (linear)
consumption function, representative of the data in the table, is now
fully specified as: $$\begin{aligned}
C = 50 + 0.5 Y.\end{aligned}$$

In macroeconomics, $a=50$ is called the level of *autonomous consumption
spending*, the level of consumption spending in an economy with zero
income. The slope $b=0.5$ is called the *marginal propensity to
consume*, which indicates that when income increases by one dollar,
consumption increases by 50 cents. Clearly, since $b=0.5 > 0$ is a
positive slope, there is a positive relationship between income and
consumption spending.

With our consumption function fully specified, we are in a position to
determine the level of consumption spending for any given level of
income, and not only those in the table. In fact, we only need data from
two rows in the table (or, alternatively, to evaluate twice the linear
function $C = 50 + 0.5 Y$) and plot the resulting graph. As an
intra-credit exercise, do this on Desmos or Google.

Figure [\[f:cfn\]](#f:cfn){reference-type="ref" reference="f:cfn"} is my
rendition of the graph of this consumption function:

The algebraic formulation (the equation form) conveys the same (in fact,
more) information than the numerical data table. And it does so in a
much more compact manner. That is the power of math!

The inverse function of a linear function
-----------------------------------------

This subsection shows how to derive the inverse function of a linear
function. Consider the general linear function $y = a + b \ x$. Then,
the following step-by-step sequence yields its inverse function:
$$\begin{aligned}
y = a + b \ x, \\
a + b \ x = y, \\
b \ x = - a + y, \\
x = - \frac{a}{b} + \frac{1}{b} \ y, \\
x = c + d \ y,\end{aligned}$$

where $$c \equiv - \left(\frac{a}{b}\right),$$
$$d \equiv \left(\frac{1}{b}\right).$$

Consider the linear equation (function) $Q_d = 100 - 2 \ p$, where $Q_d$
is the quantity of apples (in boxes) that buyers in a market wish to buy
and $p$ is the price of a box of apples (in \$/box). Figure
[\[f:dem\]](#f:dem){reference-type="ref" reference="f:dem"} shows its
graph.

Therefore, the inverse demand equation is: $$\begin{aligned}
Q_d = 100 - 2 \ p, \\
100 - 2 \ p = Q_d, \\
- 2 \ p = -100 + Q_d, \\
p = \frac{100}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ Q_d, \\
p = 50 - 0.5 \ Q_d.\end{aligned}$$

Using the formulas above, one can determine the inverse function more
quickly. Since $a = 100$ and $b=-2$, then:

$$\begin{aligned}
c \equiv - \frac{a}{b} = - \frac{100}{-2} = 50, \\
d \equiv \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{-2} = -0.5, \\
p = 50 - 0.5 \ Q_d.\end{aligned}$$

Figure [\[f:idem\]](#f:idem){reference-type="ref" reference="f:idem"}
shows the grap of the inverse demand function, which is the one most
typically shown in textbooks:

Nonlinear relationships
=======================

In this textbook, we will not use the algebraic or equation form for
nonlinear relationships between two variables, $x$ and $y$. For them, we
will only use graphs and intuition. Usually, when dealing with nonlinear
relationships, intercepts are of little or no interest. Most of the
interest focuses on the *slopes*, which are now variable rather than
constant.

Figure [\[f:con\]](#f:con){reference-type="ref" reference="f:con"}(a)
shows a curve that is concave to the origin (the point in the plane
where $x = 0$ and $y = 0$). Note that, throughout, the slope of the
curve is negative. When $x$ is close to zero, the slope is a very small
negative number (almost zero). Then, as $x$ increases, the slope of the
curve becomes increasingly negative and, when it hits the horizontal
axis, it is very negative.

Figure [\[f:con\]](#f:con){reference-type="ref" reference="f:con"}(b)
shows a graph that also slopes downward. However, this curve is convex
to the origin. When $x$ is close to zero, the slope is very high (it
tends to infinity). Then, as $x$ goes up, the curve's slope becomes less
and less negative. When it hits the horizontal axis, the slope of the
curve is almost zero.

Finally, the graph in Figure
[\[f:curve\]](#f:curve){reference-type="ref" reference="f:curve"} shows
a more complicated relationship between $x$ and $y$. This is a curve
that changes direction. When $1 < x < 1.9$ approximately and also when
$x > 3.1$, the slope of the curve is positive. For all other values of
$x$ in the graph, the slope is negative. Also note that the curve's
slope becomes zero at approximately $x = 1.9$ and also somewhere around
$x =3$. At these points the slope changes from positive to negative or
vice versa. So, a flat or horizontal tangent line can be drawn to touch
them. These points are either *maxima* or *minima* (the plural of
*maximum* and *minimum*, i.e. the highest and lowest values of $y$).

[^1]: The *caeteris paribus* assumption requires that the independent
    variables are indeed (relatively speaking) independent (or largely
    so) from one another. If at least some of $x_i$ are not sufficiently
    independent, but they vary together, then the
    "everything-else-constant" assumption may lead to serious nonsense.
    Again, in the world, things appear to be all interrelated. There
    seem to be hard limits to human cognition. Such is life!

Introduction
============

As in the physical sciences, all basic magnitudes in economics are
specified either *at a point in time* or *over a period of time*. The
distinction between these two types of magnitudes is one of the most
important ones in accounting, finance, and economics. Much confusion can
be avoided by understanding the distinction, and maintaining it
consistently when conducting economic analysis. Let us define the basic
concepts.

Definitions
===========

A *stock* magnitude (a *stock*, for short) is the value of a variable at
a given point in time. A flow magnitude (or, simply, a *flow*) is the
value of a variable for a given period of time.

Once these basic magnitudes are defined, a host of other magnitudes can
be derived as well---such as *ratios* of flows to flows, stocks to
stocks, flows to stocks, and stocks[^1] to flows.

As an analogy, consider a vessel or container with water, with one pipe
delivering additional water into the vessel, and another pipe leaking it
out. A physicist or an engineer would call this a simple "hydrodynamic
system." Figure [1](#f:sf){reference-type="ref" reference="f:sf"}
illustrates the idea.

![A container](images/stock_flow.png){#f:sf width="4.5cm"}

Stock and flow magnitudes can be used to measure the performance of this
system. A stock measure would be the amount of water in the container at
given points in time, such as Sundays at noon. Alternatively, a flow
measure would be one of the amount of water flowing into, through, or
out of the vessel over given periods of time, such as a day or month.

Then, by combining both forms of measurement, we would obtain a better
understanding of the functioning of the system. The stock measures may
help us correct errors in the measurement of flows and, vice versa.

Let $S_0$ be the amount of water in the vessel at the end of month $0$,
$i_1$ the amount of water flowing into the vessel during month $1$, and
$o_1$ the amount of water flowing out of the vessel during that same
month. Then, the net amount of water flowing *through* the vessel in
month $1$ is given by $i_1 - o_1$, and the amount of water in the
container at the end of month $1$ is: $$\begin{aligned}
S_1 = S_0 + \Delta S_1 = S_0 + i_1 - o_1.\end{aligned}$$

In words, the amount of water in the container at the end of the period
equals the amount of water in the container at the beginning of the
period, plus the water that got into it during the period, minus the
water that leaked out of it during the same period. Therefore, the
change in the stock of water from the end of month $0$ to the end of
month $1$ is the net flow of water in the month: $o_1 - i_1$.[^2]

General formula
===============

Let $t$ denote a period and its end time point. Then, the general
formula linking stocks and flows is: $$\begin{aligned}
S_{t+1} = S_t + \Delta S_{t+1} = S_t + i_{t+1} - o_{t+1}.\end{aligned}$$

Consider an example. On November 1 ($t = 0$), the amount of water in the
container is 10 gallons ($S_0 = 10$). The water flowing into the vessel
during November is 40 gallons ($i_1 = 40$) and the water flowing out of
the vessel is 39 gallons ($o_1 = 39$). The amount of water in the
container on December 1: $$\begin{aligned}
S_1 = S_0 + i_1 - o_1 = 10 + 40 - 39 = 11.\end{aligned}$$ That is, there
are eleven gallons of water in the container at the end of November. If,
mysteriously, the stock of water on December 1 is any different from
(greater than or less than) the result above, then we have made errors
in our measurements. The new measure of the water level can help us
correct our records.

A more relevant example is Peter's checking account. But, for a change,
let us also change the notation. Now, $B$ is the balance (stock), $d$
the deposits (inflows), and $w$ the withdrawals in all forms (outflows).
On November 1 ($t = 0$), the balance of Peter's checking account is 100
dollars ($B_0 = 100$). During November, Peter deposited checks his
grandmother and father sent him that totalled 400 dollars ($d_t = 400$).
Also in the month, he made electronic payments, wrote checks, and
withdrew cash from the ATM machine for a total of 390 dollars
($w_t = 390$). The balance of his account on December 1 is determined as
follows: $$\begin{aligned}
B_1 = B_0 + \Delta B_1 = B_0 + d_1 - w_1 = 100 + 400 - 390 = 110.\end{aligned}$$
That is, Peter held a balance of 110 dollars at the end of November.

Another example (using the original notation above). On January 1, 2010
($t = 0$), a town's assets were estimated in 10,000 dollars
($S_0 = 10$). In 2010, the town received local taxes and grants from the
central government totalling 40,000 dollars ($i_t = 40$). Also in 2010,
the town spent in its administration, public works, and local public
programs a total of 39,000 dollars ($o_1 = 39$). The value of the town's
assets at the end of 2010 is given by: $$\begin{aligned}
S_1 = S_0 + \Delta S_1 = S_0 + i_1 - o_1 = 10 + 40 - 39 = 11.\end{aligned}$$
That is, the town began 2011 with assets worth 11,000 dollars.

Note that the mathematical structure of the four examples above is
essentially the same.

Do the following example yourself, and submit it as intra-credit work:
As of January 1, 2010 ($t = 0$), the total wealth of an economy is
estimated in 10 billion dollars ($X_0 = 10$). During 2010, the economy
produced output estimated in 40 billion dollars ($x_{it} = 40$). ALso,
households in the economy consumed 39 billion dollars during the year
($x_{ot} = 390$). Determine the change in the outstanding wealth of the
economy in 2011 and also the economy's wealth as of January 1, 2011.

Accounting fundamentals
=======================

The two basic financial statements that accountants produce are the
*balance sheet* and *the income statement*. These financial statements
provide a detailed picture of the ongoing financial performance of a
business or organization.

The *balance sheet* of any individual or organization (such as a
business) is a report that describes the financial condition of such
entity at some given point in time.

The balance sheet has two sides. The left-hand side reports the value of
all the organization's *assets*, again, at a given point in time,
typically at the end of a year. The assets are the resources under the
management or control of the organization measured at a point in time.
The right-hand side reports the source of the value of the assets listed
on the left-hand side. They are either *owed* to others, in which case
they are called *liabilities*, or they are *owned* by the legal owners,
in which case they are called *equity*, *net worth*, or (in the case of
banks) *capital*.

In usual practice, organizations report a balance sheet every year,
quarter, and---sometimes---month. Less usual is every week or day. In
principle, it could be determined at each and any point in time.
Real-time balance sheets are now the rule thanks to modern day
computers.

The fundamental equation of the balance sheet is: $$\begin{aligned}
A_t = L_t + E_t\end{aligned}$$

where $t$ indicates a point in time (e.g. the last day of the year), $A$
is total assets, $L$ is total liabilities, and $E$ is total equity.[^3]

As an example, consider the following balance sheet of a typical firm.
See table [1](#t:bal){reference-type="ref" reference="t:bal"}.

::: {#t:bal}

  : ABC, Inc.'s balance sheet as of 12/31/2010
:::

All items in the balance sheet are *stock* measures. So, whenever you
consider a balance sheet, think of "water in a container" measured at a
point in time.

In the balance sheet, by convention, asset items are viewed as positive
stock magnitudes while liabilities and equity items are negative stock
magnitudes.

The *income statement* (or result statement or profit-loss statement) of
any individual or organization (such as a business) is a report that
describes the financial activity of the organization over a given period
time.

The income statement reports on its *top line* the total flow of *gross
income* (e.g. sales revenues) received by the organization during a
period of time (e.g. a year) as a positive number. The next lines report
the various expenses that the activity of the organization incurred
during the period to sustain its gross income. These expenses---sorted
out as production costs, operating expenses, financial expenses, and
taxes---are deducted or subtracted from the top line. In other words,
they are regarded as negative numbers. Finally, the *bottom line* of the
income statement indicates the flow of *net income* or *net profit* (if
the net income is positive) or *net loss* (if the net income is
negative) during the period.

The fundamental equation of the income statement is: $$\begin{aligned}
NI_t = GI_t - PC_t - OE_t - FE_t - Tt\end{aligned}$$ where $t$ is the
period of time from point in time $t-1$ to point in time $t$, $NI$ is
the residual income or net income (net profit or net loss), $GI$ is the
gross income (typically, revenues from sales, though it may include
rental income and interest income the organization may receive during
the period), $PC$ is the total cost of goods sold (such as cost of raw
materials, storage costs, wages and benefits of factory-floor workers),
$OE$ are the operating expenses (sales and administrative expenses,
including salaries and commissions of administrative and sales personnel
and depreciation of fixed assets), $FE$ is financial expenses (interest
paid on outstanding liabilities), and $T$ is taxes paid.

As an illustration, consider the following income statement for some
typical firm: See table [2](#tab:inc){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:inc"}.

  : ABC, Inc.'s income statement from 1/1/2010 through 12/31/2010
:::

Note that all items in the income statement are *flow* measures. Think
of them as "water that flows in or out of the container" over a period
of time.

In the income statement, the convention is that revenues (from sales)
are regarded as positive flows and all costs and expenses as negative
flows.

As shown with the vessel analogy above, the balance sheet and the income
statement are intimately related.

Again, it is useful to think that, every time an organization conducts
an operation or transaction, every time a business takes raw materials
from its inventories and have its workers process them on the factory
floor, every time its sales people sell a batch of goods or its
administrative personnel orders a shipment from its suppliers, every
time a payment is made or received, etc. there is "water flowing" from
one balance-sheet "container" into another one. At the end of the given
period (and beginning of the next period), the balance sheet reports the
adjusted levels of "water in each container at that point in time."

Also at the end of the given period (beginning of the next), each spurt
of "water" that flowed from "container" to "container" during the period
is added up (aggregated) into its respective category and recorded in
the income statement. The legal owners of the organization (if a
corporation, the legal owners are called *stockholders* or
*shareholders*) pay most attention to the level of "water" in their
equity "container."

The examples above should make it clear that the principles of
accounting are the same whether they are applied to one household,
business, entity, or organization, including a national economy or the
entire global economy for that matter.

The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)---with rules set by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a private sector
organization---that are used in business practice, are a set of detailed
conventions based on these fundamental principles. The national income
and product accounts (NIPA) and the balance of payments (BoP) accounts
kept by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, the flow of funds (FoF) accounts kept by the Federal Reserve
("Fed"), and the data on prices, employment, pay, and productivity kept
by Bureau of Labor Statistics, all of them statistical records intended
to measure the performance of the U.S. economy, are based on these very
principles. Other national statistics agencies, central banks, and
international organizations---such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank (WB), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the
United Nations (UN)---apply the same principles to their statistical
collection efforts.

Further details are the subject matter of formal courses in financial
accounting, macroeconomics, and other particular fields.

[^1]: The term *stock* has several meanings in economics and finance. It
    also refers to the equity or residual wealth claimed by the legal
    owners of a company traded in the market. The context should make it
    clear when the term is used in one or another sense.

[^2]: Evaporation and any other form of water entering or leaving the

[^3]: To separate an organization from its individual owners, it may be
    convenient to state the equation as A = L, i.e. assets equal
    liabilities. They are liabilities to either others or to the
    individual "owners" of the organization. In this interpretation, the
    equity of the legal owners of, e.g., a business is considered a
    special type of liability.
